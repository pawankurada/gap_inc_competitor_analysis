2023,"Amazing experience, recomand",5
2023,the app is slow. everything is out of stock,2
2023,"website never works, app is the bomb, clothing should be pictured in 1/2/4 grid options for quick scrolling and able to move fast through sections the app has never been user friendly for fast purchases. two many of the same clothing options are featured in 3 different versions (just colours variants) in different spots on the page, put the same item grouped together with the colours then move onto an item it doesn't make it clear to customers the item comes in several colours=loss of sales",4
2023,"I purchased an article while in France but I couldn't retrieve it in time. I was told I could be reimbursed but it never happened. The chat is very slow, turns off very fast to the point that you have to restart conversation everytime. None of my interlocutors were able to give a proper answer.",1
2023,"Write the model's height, so that I don't have to return the stuff that can only be bought online. Also, your measure of items are not always accurate.",4
2023,"Awesome clothing,love the fit and style",5
2023,Not a good app,1
2023,delivery takes too long,1
2023,"This app hangs too much, just a big no.",2
2023,"Worst app..nothing can be seen on the app except for menu items. If I click on any menu item, only blank image is displayed. And yes FYI there is no internet issue. My remaining apps are working absolutely fine. I have uninstalled it.",1
2023,cant do online return with shipping,1
2023,a lot of bugs in the app.,1
2023,"Love the products but payment is worst, gets stuck everytime.",2
2023,"Horrible online service. I don't know what kind of people working at their warehouse. They keep sending orders to wrong addresses and wrong stores for pick up. And then they can not even provide you any help. They are so incompetent people, if you buy anything buy at the store. And if you have to use their website or app, good luck!",2
2023,I love zara💝,5
2023,very efficient app,5
2023,J'aDore lots... Perfect ...,5
2023,This app is unreliable. It seldom works. You're better off just ordering from/ perusing the website.,1
2023,Great content and usability!,5
2023,I Can't login my account！,1
2023,"The lastest update is soo bad. So many bugs are there, not able to load the image of product only.it is so irritating to use the app.",1

2023,I gave 5 star because items are very nice in app but it not for middle class family 👪,5
2023,Unable to add peoduct to wishlist from either qr code or manually typin in the code. However it is working on ios.,1
2023,couldn't select store for pick up,1
2023,After update I cannot see any item in the menu. I just see a white screen that's it.,2
2023,The most irresponsible brand I would say. I've ordered some shoes from them. it's been 13 days since I ordered them.the courier service is showing for the past 10 days that the parcel in is my city but they are not delivering it.... and everyday whenever I go to check their website it extend 1 day for the delivery..e.g. today is 19 September when today I checked it says they will deliver it tomorrow I.e. 20 September. for the past 10 days they are doing the same trend. Zara is doing nothing abou,1
2023,Great app,5
2023,Why so many updates??,3
2023,รูปเสียไม่แก้,5
2023,Standard in UK. I live in NL.,3

2023,"everything you see in store, u can choose to buy from app and send to any Zara stores near you, it is very convenient!",5
2023,the UI on the phone sucks - the buttons are tiny and hard to hit! I do love the feature to tap your NFC card to auto fill details tho!,3
2023,"Zara customer service is bad. They aren't supportive. Had to give back a certain amount, which they don't take responsibility at all.",1

2023,Good,4
2023,I used to like it but the current version is terrible. everything is too complicated especially search and navigation.,2
2023,great service,5
2023,The latest version is very disappointing. Worst user interface I have ever seen. The design from filter buttons to font are ridiculous. The designer's ego has gotten in the way of creating a truly user-friendly experience.,1
2023,cool store,5
2023,I can't log in for a last few days. It says: Your request cannot be completed at this time. I uninstalled and installed the app again but nothing changes.,1

2023,"The previous app version worked flawlessly. Now it is buggy, slow and the previous app design was much better.",3
2023,"Es ist wirklich unübersichtlich. Ich lag die Produktansicht nicht, da sich viele Teile wiederholen. Es ist insgesamt kompliziert aufgebaut.",2
2023,"The wish list function is not working, cannot see pictures. Total pain have to go on my laptop to order",2
2023,"In regards to ordering/service- great app. However, certain items have been mismatched for about 6 months. Example- I create a search for flats and scan downward. The items could be off by 1, 2, etc. I'll click on the initial picture of flats I like. After clicking, the item (on the previous menu) just before appears, and so on. Droid phone/app",5
2023,"Hi there, my friend had this app for long long time. After update, icon stayed the same but the name changed and there is no more option POD ?!?! The name of the app is design-system-compose, but it apears when you install it. Is this copy or what?? You are robbing people or your app is compromised???",1
2023,Awesome,4
2023,"Bad app with very bad customer service , their customer service always use the same lie; we will contact you later regarding your issue..... then you will never hear from them again. Just a cheap way to lie to the customers. The app itself is very bad and slow, the fact that you have to see a model showing you the product is kind of old, nowadays most apps have the option of showing the product on model or no. Your cart will disappear suddenly so you will have to start over!",1
2023,Horrible ..can't even register,1
2023,"it's to complicated, so many steps!",2

2023,"The latest update is so bad!!! there is no option of filtering through categories. I don't want to go through everything while i just want a dress, the interface has become so bad, bad user experience, not an enjoyable design, fire yourself ui ux designer asap and please get us back the old version. Uninstallling the app till then.",1
2023,The worst eCom user experience ever. The buying and finding experience was much better before this ridiculous and unnecessary design change.,2
2023,"Incerc sa aflu informatii legate de un retur prin chat. Se raspunde extrem de greu si cu 0 informatii utile, la un moment dat le am spus ca nu imi raspunde la intrebari, mi au spus ca am o atitudine si mi au inchis chat ul. Am deschis alt chat pentru a face sesizare, mi s a inchis si acesta, pentru ca nu voiau sa imi dea o adresa de mail unde pot face sesizare. Mentionez ca nu am folosit cuvinte nepotrivite, doar le am mentionat ca nu mi au dat nici o informatie.",1
2023,Good for me,5
2023,"Everything seems to be good! The clothes are good, and the quality feels on par seeing the price tags. But, i have one suggestion, why would there not be an option to review the clothes or other accessories we purchase on your platform? Well, the platform like H&M has the option to review their products. Hope you guys look into it.",3

2023,"Why are pictures not showing up? This app is not user friendly at all....literally have to shut down and reopen app for the pictures to show up. Messy home page, wishlist hard to navigate......it was much better before.",2
2023,it's the worst website I've ever experienced,1
2023,the app has some bugs!,3
2023,Zara's clothes are of very poor quality. His clothes look good in the photos on his app.and the surface of their app is also not good.Zara's clothes are not good. HNM's clothes are good and its quality is also good and it is also available cheaply.Zara's delivery charge 250₹ but HNM has no delivery charge and their refund policy is also very good.,1

2023,"The new UI update is terrible, unintuitive if I may say.. The previous one was much better, and the app is much slower for some reason. I really love your clothes, but the new updates are actually a downgrade.",1
2023,Everything is good but they don't bring back the items back to stock. The famous quilted chain bag is out of stock since several months but never comes back!!!,1

2023,"Stupid, delivery service. I did not even receive the item and it says delivered. I filed an incident, but they say it's delivered. I just spent 70$ on thin air.",1
2023,The worst shopping app I've ever used.,1
2023,♥️,5
2023,"Everytime I open the app there are no photos or pictures, just the writing. When you click on an item to look at it and go back, it takes you right back to the top, quite frustrating when you have already scrolled through a hundred items. Please please update it or change it back to the original format.",1
2023,Frustrating app. Logs you out on it's own. Can't even log in again.,1
2023,"Apparently, you have added the option of ""scan receipt"" just recently which is great. But it's not functional. I mean when I open that new option, I get things like : Add ticket, Scan the product QR. However, nothing happens when I click on those two features! Would you please solve this issue as soon as possible. Thanks!",3
2023,Last update is bad,1
2023,Hopeless after upgrade,1
2023,"Zara itself has the worst customer service,it blocks online shopping and creates instore pickup anytime .",1

2023,"New version doesn't show pictures of items in your cart, new items don't load anymore only the item name and price?? New items when you can view them are out of stock. Then it's the dumb sounds the app makes. Zero stars",1

2023,Keeps not letting me log in,1
2023,nice products 👌 👍 😊 😍,5
2023,"App was fine the way it was until they changed the layout to a terrible one which is an eye sore. When I click on an the image of an item it will show a different item! Zara app, what happened to you???",1
2023,"Got really bad.Once was my favorite app, I used to order a lot. But lately I often can't get authorized, every time it makes me change the password. I talked to support but they just told me to change password, and then try again, and then try from pc. So now again I'm out of my account and I can't log in. And when you scroll I'll down then click on the item so to see description , then get back to the list it brings u all way up to the beginning 🤣",1
2023,"Nueva version muy lenta, pide update cada 2 por 3. Era mucho mejor",2
2023,What's with the pop-up error message with each log in and when adding to car....? 😑😖💀,1
2023,"The latest update is a disaster: 1. If you click on an item and click back, taken back to the beginning of the list. Clicked on item halfway out of 400 items clicked back and sent back to the beginning of list 2. When in Special Prices/Sale sections can only filter by Size/Colour/Price, no filter by Category. If I'm just looking for bags I don't want to scroll through 100s of other items 3. Sections are too basic e.g. Accessories/Jewellery no direct link to Scarfs/Sunglasses/Belts anymore.",1
2023,"So annoying. You click to view a product, you press back, it takes you back to the top of the list. This happened with the old version too. Such a basic function that doesn't work",1
2023,It doesn't want to download,1
2023,I could not use promo code .because promo code option could not show up,1
2023,New user interface is not good at all.. please revert back to old one.,1

2023,we need more Zara stores,5
2023,There are always troubles with this app. Very disappointed 😞,2
2023,"Very good App, excellent functionality, and frequently updated. Before use, it is helpful to check if there is a new update",4
2023,scammers! by far one of the worst in online shopping.,1
2023,The worst app known to mankind. Painful to use. Don't know what's worse the service on their stores or the app. The only justifiable purchase is during the sales. Don't waste your money on full price items.,1
2023,"New version is awful, I can not select store for drop point. Button does not work.",1
2023,The latest update is very discussing. The app is very laggy and unresponsive.,1
2023,"2.new update is the same problem, pictures cannot downloading, I have to close and open again, can you update it?? The new update is bad and cannot downloading the pics of the clothes, every time I have to close and open again. Can you please fix it and also the sound. Very annoying! Jó napot, folyamatosan lefagy az alkalmazás ha az egyik kedvencek listát megnyitom,teljesen használhatatlan, lehetne kérni valami frissitest ,hibák javítását? Köszönöm",2
2023,"Poor service, what they always do is to apologize, they kept my Order at the warehouse for two weeks even today it has not been delivered.",1
2023,Very slow seems like zara isn't interested in online stores.,1
2023,Having trouble to install,1
2023,I hate the sound with every click and i uninstalled it because i thought my phone is bugged and also no filter for the least price to high and high to low,3
2023,Every week new update and app is slowr and slower. In the newest version when i make order and choose place to pick up the the select button od the pick up location does not work. Deleted and install older version,1
2023,Can't log in,1
2023,Love zara,5
2023,quality product with a mid range price..,5
2023,You request cannot be completed..always pop up like that everytime enter my account..please fix it,1
2023,"I am unable to select a pick-up store for clothes in my cart, and whenever I enter an item and go back, it takes me to the beginning of my list of saved items, which is quite frustrating.",1
2023,with latest update i cannot log-in anymore. i need to use web browser and log with same credentials that don't work with app. them what's the purpose of it?!?!;!,1
2023,"Since the update the app is no longer usable, unable to nominate a dropoff point!",1
2023,I love Zara app,5
2023,really dangerous if you like shopping awesome ways to save and create lists,5
2023,"This latest app version is very confusing, honestly, sometimes the updates are not having the same result or impact. Please reconsider, difficult to find something, very unclear to browse, too square...",2
2023,I ordered 3-4year baby jumpsuit and got 13-14year baby jumpsuit without outer tag i send him all pics and bar code but they denied to return and not accept their fault so I got terrible experience.we can't trust them,1
2023,With last update ..i cant bought anything..give error when i go to cart,1
2023,"Horrible UX, worse and worse since 2020 I just took a little bit of my time to come here and give this feedback. I usually don't do this, but it's frustrating as hell and it keeps getting worse. Now they also have sounds, which even if you disable, you can still hear it. Images don't load at least 50% of the time in favorites(besides the weird way of getting there) It's hard to give an overall good solution to this. Just revert everything to 2020ish plus add favorites and that's all.",1
2023,since the last update I can't see any pictures,1
2023,Worst application using experience ever.,1
2023,After the update the app is laggin and I have to clear cache again and again.,1
2023,"I used to love the app but the recent updates are driving me crazy, the sounds is super annoying and I don't know how to nevigate with the new interface, I try to look for coats from sale selection but somehow can not. Also the most annoying thing is when you click one item and back then it went all the way to the top which I have to scroll all the way down to where I was!!!! Very bad user experience overall.",1
2023,Good,3
2023,Very bad user experience. Scroll is not working on most of the pages. Favourite list does not remember selected tab when you go back after checking some item. Very unexpected behavior.,1
2023,La nueva app no carga rapido ni va nada fluida. Ademas ese nuevo formato es poco accesible.,1
2023,"Since the update the list goes to the beginning after having selected some item for details, which makes it rather unbearable. Please, correct as it used to be.",3
2023,"The New layout is terrible. Make the navigation and the shopping experience difficult, why to change such a nice and easy app for this new version?",1
2023,Worst update ever got stuck pics don't show up ect,1
2023,"How on earth turn the annoying app sound off (even I disabled the sound in the setting, it is STILL ON!!!) NOT a fan of this version, please fix this!",1
2023,Scrolling bug,1
2023,"1 star for quality fabric, 1 star for latest fashioned cloth, -1 star for high shipping charges, -1 star for product unavailability(mostly), -1 star for bizzare cloth style, -1 star for 100 rs.returning fee = overall 1 star for Zara. (Shipping is free on purchase of a large amount of goods or else a huge amount of about 290 rupees has to be paid in the form of shipping charge, which is absolutely illegitimate. So I dislike it. )",1
2023,"Ever since the last update, I've been facing a problem where the images of the product wouldn't load. The entire app is useless if I can't see any products. Reopening the app or restarting the phone didn't fix it. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Which fixed it for 3 days, and now it's gone blank again. I don't want to go through reinstalling this app every time I want to use it.",1
2023,Your user interface has become so bad . It's like zara has just launched. Your UI was good before . Please change it back . Iltye menu option give me feeling like there are some sticky notes ☹️ Please change it back to original one,2
2023,"I used to believe - and would tell anyone - that the Zara app was the best, until the latest update turned it into one of the worst. I don't understand why you changed from the most user-friendly platform to the most frustrating app. Please revert to the previous version.",1
2023,"I dislike the tag-like layout of the items, in the menu section. Why would you complicate the app like this? Scrolling worked fine.",3
2023,It's the best app to keep your wallets empty.,5
2023,great quilty of clothing,5
2023,Real othentic quality,5
2023,"After last update (27/7/23) shopping cart is not available at all,you have some serious bug.",1
2023,Imagine doesn't show.,2
2023,it would be nice the app to notify us when prices of our favorite items drop. Sometimes the app crushes or is laggish although the internet connection is perfect. Some products in the store are priced higher than the online store.,1
2023,Sound is annoying! Even disabled it still sounds.,4
2023,amazing products. I love the quality,5
2023,"Latest update seems to have come with in-app sounds, which cannot be turned off, because I have sounds disabled in the app and I can still hear them. Drives me insane.",1
2023,Pathetic these guys and there delivery partners have screwed my hard earned money after giving all valid proofs there is no answer from zara Refund my hard earned money man,1
2023,"Can't disabled sounds and animations even when changing the setting. It's so much slower than the website also and the search does not work. If I look for something in the website I can find it,but not in the apo",3
2023,The app doesn't even open. Just shows Zara logo and nothing else.,1
2023,New update is aweful. Don't you have UX/UI team working on reserch? Its so not user friendly..i cant even navigate properly and i am a customer who litrally uses the app daily. So imagine! Its totally bad lauout and UI. The previous one worked fine. Bring it back pls.,1
2023,"I HATE the update 1, The sound is irritating and is always on, even when it's turned off from the settings. Why the sound anyawy? 2, The list goes back all the way to the beginning whenever any product is showing. (If i pressed to see a jeans, then i go back... the screen will go all the way up) 3, Some areas CANNOT be clicked, if i need to see the color options (the product is coming is different colors), well i cannot press on the color optios and the text is overlapping with the menu options",2
2023,I bought a lot of clothes from zara app and they had amazing quality and looked the same as it did on the photos,5
2023,Easy to buy and collect,5
2023,Remove the sound asap!Can this app get more annoying? No search options for sizes available. Keeps showing out of stock items. Now it also has an annoying sound every time I look at an item. Whoever designed this should be fired. It is not cool it is annoying.,1
2023,Who dosn't love ZARA....🥰👍👍👍👍👍,5
2023,Good app,5
2023,"The last update is awful, too many lines, it hurts my eyes, why did you do that? The app worked perfectly. Maybe you need to hire a new frontend team.",1
2023,Terrible my app just updated randomly and now its impossible to use. 1 the layout looks so bad 2 when you look at a item then go back a step it will take u all the way to the top of the page and not where u last were. 3 when ordering the option to to pick up from store seems to not work been trying all day. Juat the overall layout is poor compared to what it was,1
2023,"This lastest version is the worst, not easy to navigate and not user friendly, every time we click on item to see it's details and then close it, it takes us to the top of the items list, very annoyinggggggg... In addition to the sound and animation that still working despite the disable option we selected.",1
2023,New app update is awful and the noise every time you click on an item is annoying,1
2023,Worst,1
2023,"who the hell updated this good app into garbage, even garbage works and is useful...",2
2023,Super,4
2023,"Pointless, annoying sounds. Disabling sounds doesn't actually disable the sounds",1
2023,The more they are updating the app the more it gets unfriendly using. There is sounds and vibrations everytime I click on the items...very annoying!! But I am unable to disable it.,1
2023,"This new update is horrific, how does this app keep getting worse",1
2023,"Pathetic app and pathetic update. The new update looks like it's designed by some kid. Additionally, the service by Zara is pathetic too. I have received damaged perfumes several times but this time totally different perfume was sent than what I ordered. Also, you'll have to suffer a lot if you have to return these non returnable products with the help of support team. I haven't received my refund yet. Never buying anything from Zara.",1
2023,ಯಪ್ಪಾ... ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ರೊಕ್ಕ ನಾ ಕಡಿಮಿ ಮಾಡ್.. ಬಡುವುರ್ ಮಂದಿ ಹೊಯ್ಕೋತ ಹೋಗ್ತಾರ್..,1
2023,Not functional or practical to navigate. Too much lag and the layout is more style over substance. This isn't a glossy magazine. Please just design an app that fits it's purpose...,1
2023,Good,5

We may add the wrong item or later decide to keep an item or add more items. We have to call for you to recreate the return. The old one remains active in the list, which is very confusing.

2023,Clean and easy to use BUT huge down point for the site is the lack of sizing guide for clothing. Most other sites have the height and size of the model along with the measurements of garments. The models are far too skinny and very unrealistic for your average person shopping on here. Would absolutely love to see a mix of model shapes and sizes in Zara clothes. As an average person I ordered with the risk of returning everything.,3

Me he abierto ya varios perfiles y siempre vuelve a salir sin posibilidad de editarlo. No entiendo cómo pone que se pueden añadir varias direcciones y luego no te deja cambiar la región, está como capado ya que no se activa. Otro fallo que veo importante es que no deja meter muchos filtros.",1

I just made a new account... no confirmation email received either. I don't know where the hiccup is, but please fix it!!!!",1
2023,Well to be honest they arent the best. They don't seem to try to accomdate inconveniences that arise in regard to customer service . They could have been of assistance to the issue but they disregarded the matter without even trying to find other alternatives. VERY DISAPPOINTING,1

Did you calculate how much money you loose because of this!!!! Design total disaster again: change it waaaay to often and it is not functional, you can barely see which size is available. It used to be bolded now all of them have the same font. Shall I mention Customer Service???? Unprepared, not trained, stubborn, do not escalate problems.",1

You'll return items then they claim not to have got all items at the warehouse (even though they were all in one parcel) and the rest is history, say goodbye to your money.

2023,So many great stuff but i can't place out my orders because it won't let me change my billing address. I hope that improves.,2
2023,Layout of app is horrendous. They have tried too hard to make the app different but the only thing this has done is make it very difficult to find items & ordering is a nightmare. Who ever created this app needs to rethink the entire site. Too frustrating to use.,1

2023,The app is broken! I had to use their site to check on my order since I have no access to my account on their app!!!,2
2023,It kept closing while i was doing a purchase other than that its okay,2
2023,I downloaded this app to try it out for end of the year sales. I opened app to get in on special pricing for men's Cologne product Lisboa. The product was not available from opening time of sale until end of sale. An absolute waste of time for installation of app to checking multiple times a day for weeks. I did also go to multiple store locations throughout the sale period but product was never available anywhere. Very disappointed.,1

2023,Worst app... Please never order from Zara they take forever to deliver the order and also if you return then it'll take a lot of days for them to refund your money. Customer service is the most terrible thing about them. wish I could give 0 stars,1

2023,"Bad quality products, their sizes differ so whatever you order doesn't fit and have to return and then that charge you for return shipping. Charge you shipping for 'discounted items', just very bad brand. On app, sorting is a no brainer and they cannot get that right either.",2
2023,"Do not use this app. It is not convenient to purchase thru this app especially for returns. I tried to use the E-voucher they issued for the returned items to pay for my next purchase. I was not able to check out. The app keeps going back to payment mode after I scan the qr code. Their online chat is also useless. The delivery of items purchased is very slow. Same with returning items purchased. If you like Zara clothes, purchase from the physical store.",1

2023,Super app,5
2023,"Login disabled, can't add items to my basket or favorites. The add buttons, login button, and profile area in general are removed from the app",1
2023,Like it! Love shopping in Zara especially the kids section.,5
2023,yes boy,5
2023,Can't login or purchase on the app anymore.,1
2023,"App removed the basket and ""favourite"" icons",1
2023,Excellent site with fast access,5
2023,Shipping is too much,2
2023,Favourites and cart disappeared from the app 😏 what a lame update,1
2023,happy to shoping with zara thank you,5
2023,Excelente,5
2023,"Never knew Zara had such awesome sales!!! Guess what, they even have larger sizes now too. Oh! U can shop Massimo Dutti right on the same site ..Go Zara!! :)",5
2023,"What happened with the app? In the newest version, I do not have my account, I can not add products on favourites or in the basket or buy a product from the app. Is this how it is supposed to be, or is it a major bug?",1
2023,The shopping basket is non existent anymore. Sometimes the option to add to basket disappears. Scrolling through a product is too sensitive. You end up showing product details instead of the next photo. The only good things are the chat feature (when someone finally replies) and how quickly the product availability updates,2
2023,It doesn't work most of the time.,1
2023,"Cart is not showing in application, please fix bugs",1
2023,Love it!,5
2023,"I can not even see my profile or shop mode with newest update. Why is this app even for if I cant shop, log in etc...?",1
2023,best shoping app,5
2023,"Reset password, doesn't work - generate email for reset password and after I got email (I had to use website), the link doesn't work as well (I had to use web version again).",3
2023,I like 👍,5
2023,"Again, more issues with the app! 1. All items that are saved in ""Favourites"" list can't be open, when you click on the images, app is closing !!! How to shop??? 2. Items that are saved in ""Favourites"" list, show they are available, but when you click on ""Add"" button nothing available 3. When you click on the item to view then you go out, it goes back to the top of the list!!! Fix these issues, because it's not possible to shop from Favourites list.",1
2023,So Expensive,1
2023,"It seems that on Android it is not working anymore. You are not able to see your orders, your baskets or anything else.",1
2023,You cant login all of a sudden?! Why?! Cant get a look for my packages and orders 😕👺,1
2023,I wish the apps show order tracking better because it doesn't tell that my shipment is coming from out of country storage,2
2023,awesome,5
2023,great,5
2023,"Stop trying too hard, just make the app and website simple and user friendly. I have given up shopping at Zara because the app and website are too painful to use!! Seriously guys, rethink and redo the design because at the moment it sucks. JUST KISS.. KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID.",1
2023,nice service,5
2023,Amazing,5
2023,"Looks great, nightmare to use. Frequently scrolls off items as it's so touchy and twice now I've had to revert to website as it seemingly just won't let me pay: stuck in a perpetual cycle of 'add card for payment'. Never known a more frustrating app tbh.",2
2023,Not better experience,5
2023,"This is not user friendly. Scrolling between product images is too sensitive and this new update is ridiculous. You can hardly see how to add an item to the invisible basket. Seriously, where is the basket?",1
2023,ok,3
2023,Terrible service. With product check they are very bad with product quality check and dont listen to concerns,1
2023,Crashing. Really bad UX. Can't log returns. Where did personal profile & basket or purchase history disappear to??? Why add an item when you can't find the basket to complete the trxn?,1
2023,Love it and everything is so easy,5
2023,Love love,5
2023,good,5
2023,easy to use and updates quickly,5
2023,290/- is just too much shipping cost inspite of purchasing goods with bill amount almost 3700/- .,4
2023,Getting warning. Unable to add item to cart,1
2023,"I had to try 5 times so it could take my payment, then I had to close the app and opener again to be able to pay.",4
2023,Functions keep disappearing one by one,3
2023,"Just updated the Zara App. Now I don't have Profile, purchase or anything 😡😡😡😡",1
2023,"It used to be a great app. But, after the last update, app doesn't show the cart and doesn't have the option to add things in cart, doesn't show user account icon, neither favorites. Oops!! What is the point then Zara?? Just to look at some nice clothes?? Please fix it!! Thanks.",2

2023,App is slow,3
2023,expensive,1
2023,"Super bad after service, 3 out of 4 items of my order they canceled w/o any confirmation, the refund process is super complicated, I ordered 27Dec2022, they canceled 3 items at 29Dec2022, I ask regarding refund process, they said wait until I received the 1 item that can be processed, I got 1 item at 31Dec, I reconfirm the refund, they said they will send the email for the refund, but until now 14Jan2023, THEY HAVEN'T SENT ANY REFUND CONFIRMATION EMAIL YET, HOW LONG I HAVE TO WAIT ANYMORE?!",1
2023,App is being frozen sometime,4
2023,"Love Zara!! Best to shop online selection over in store. But, the staff at LA Plaza in McAllen TX is great!!",5
2023,Favorite list is not working. When I click on the list the app broke.,2
2023,verynice,5
2023,please provide exchange option,4
2023,it's freezing many times,2
2023,"El envío no es gratis ni aunque pagues 90euros cuando hay descuentos. Tampoco te reservan la cesta de la compra hasta que no has finalizado la compra, frustrante cuando vas a pagar y te han quitado artículos! Mezquinos con el cliente, lo siento.",2
2023,"not flexible payment, not convinient",2
2023,Couldnt finish the purchase - after trying to use three different payment methods the app shows me the initial page Also the main page with a slider is a bit confusing and i couldnt find how to turn on the Navigation bar,2
2023,it soesnt have visa card payment method only in gift cards or cash.,1
2023,"delivery cost should be zero, with reduced articles delivery cost payment idea is bad.",5
2023,v. good,5
2023,Dreadful app and dreadful customer service,1
2023,Shipment is awful .,1
2023,Good,5
2023,"Worst experience ever!!!!!!! Bubch of liars sitting as customer support who can't help in any manner. Whenever you reach out to them, they just ask you to wait till 48 hours for update and once 48 hours completed and you reach out to them again they will simply apologize and ask you to wait another 48 hours. Fed up with the services bunch of liars and thieves sitting there!!!!!",1

2023,Thouroughly disappointing. Won't let me log in! Says account doesnt exist? Even though I have logged in on chrome and havent changed my credential details. Cleared cache and still doesnt work. Extremely frustrating.,1
2023,The worst worst app for shopping i ever seen... Return pickup for this brand is too too delay... The customer always have to chat for 1-1 item for retun pick... This is the only brand who alse charge for return pickup.. but still return pickup is not been completed on time... Worst app,1

2023,"Great app, good separation between men and women's section unlike other apps, does a good job of recommending products based on what I've looked at previously. The one thing I don't like is navigation, it's strange to scroll down to see the second picture of the same product rather than the usual horizontal swiping and sometimes swiping down while looking at a product, it goes back to the menu. Not an app error but definitely a strange choice from developers.",3
2023,high quality,5
2023,I am not able to make payment at the time of the checkout.,1
2023,One of the best shopping app Love Zara,5
2023,Worst clothing brand when it comes to returns. Wouldn't even let me change the size of a pair of trousers that I got for Christmas from a medium to a large because my relative who purchased them for me purchased them in November so the returns period had expired by Christmas. Horrible customer service.,1
2023,The website and application accessibility is terrible.,1
2023,Very nice app working very fine and it's not lagging at all,5
2023,Poor app with compatibility issues. I can't return items through my mobile phone. The app keeps hanging. Can't even chat to customer service,1

2023,The app crashes when i goto favourites and try to open the products i selected as favourites. Other than that I really like the app but currently I'm unable to purchase from my mobile. Thankyou,4

2022,Poor delivery and return experience.,1
2022,Pathetic app.,1
2022,Its better to buy from the physical store because nowadays this app makes me feel like its extorting my money. * The price tag shows ₹1990 and i paid like ₹2500 through this app for the same item. * ₹290 delivery charge on discounted products doesnt matter if you carts subtotal is 50k which is weirdly unusual. * ₹100 for return . Someday they will introduce additional amount for the packaging📦 lol... This was last purchase from the app never going to purchase from this app,1
2022,just superb Quality and styles,5
2022,i love Zara choth,5

2022,I lost everything in my basket when I went to check out and was asked to log into my account!!! I was gutted because I couldn't find the items again as they were sold out sadly. I would have spent double the amount I did the second time. my daughter was very let down.,3

2022,issues with measurements,4
2022,"Horrible UI - the system won't even let me purchase anything because it keeps glitching on my invoicing address. It tells me I can change it anytime in my profile, but the same thing happens! I added another address, thinking I will be able to change the second to the invoicing address, but of course it doesn't even have that capability! Also, it tells me things are in stock, go to the basket and they are out of stock.... ridiculous!",1
2022,"Zara kenapa jika kodepos di isi sesuai alamat tidak bs melanjutkan pemesanan , harus diisi kodepos kota yg ada zara store nya. Tujuan online shoppingnya apa cm untuk daerah2 yg ada toko saja",1
2022,the app does not give you the option to arrange items according to least to most expensive etc.. meaning I have to scroll through everything which is very time consuming and unnecessary,2
2022,why shipping charges,1
2022,"Guys enable the app to also allow you to collect an item at tge store of your choice , not only the nearest to your home adress",3
2022,really difficult navigatinb site keep crashing and things leaving my basket which made check out take over an hour to process,1
2022,discount prices are not appealing comparing to other retailers. It's always been like this with Zara. Customers need to see more lower prices at this time of the year considering the economic situation people are going through.,3
2022,Great app,5
2022,waited over 30 min for order to actually process,1
2022,You provide us the best tshirt and Jean's,5

2022,"you should have allowed us to adjust the address in the last step, I have to go back to add the new address in my profile and fill in the credit card details all over again, it's not practical.",1
2022,good,5
2022,It dosent detect country correctly. Has unintuitive setting. Has in app pop ups. Drains phone battery quick for a simple app.,1
2022,Super bad no one buy from this app if u wanna shopping online shine is the best but zara online no in mall better than online no no no😝😶😕😠,1
2022,best fashion app,5
2022,Horrible app. There's a bug in the change invoice address section. Can't change your address where your invoices are sent. Can't assign a new address for invoices to be sent either. Quite an important part of the app that they need to fix.,1
2022,"Awful. Stock information lives life of its own. I specifically travelled to particular stores relying on stock info and the goods weren't available. I repeated the same after few weeks - no change. Both times it showed ""available"" and both times store staff didn't have it. That's in several stores, not just one.",1
2022,shipping is expensive put your store on lazada for cheaper shipping,4
2022,Terrible app. Chat kicks you out after a few minutes saying I've been inactive and I've been waiting for them to respond? I'm supposedly talking to a real person on the chat but it's clearly robots asking the same questions over and over and taking 10 minutes to reply each time. Issue with ordering vouchers has become so complicated and time consuming I've ended up taking my business elsewhere. V v v disappointed Zara,1

2022,"Worst shopping experience ever, I always shop from the shops in Jordan ' , however I shopped online on black Friday, the order took more than 10 days to be received and the pants I got which are a part of the order is wrong and not what ordered, when I tried to contact the help center, both times Christina and may have not helped me and were so rude Im never shopping online again PS this is was in Jordan",1

I could track my order which i received within 3 days. I opted for Cash on delivery reason being it was my first order and the reviews were so awful. One more thing which you might be worried of- the size guide, this feature is so helpful and you can absolutely rely on it. The app's works well though it's surprising to read the reviews.",5

2022,I don't like zara app the app is not working properly at a bad experience that much I expect this app did not work like that much,1
2022,Absolutely love clothes from Zara. whenever I comment on someone wearing something they always say it's from Zara. If I buy something in the 2nd hand shop it's always from Zara too. I do find that their stuff comes up small especially their trousers but I just buy 1 size up and it fits. their trousers also can come up long so most times I have to get them taken up.Yoy can't go wrong with their stuff and it never dates. I can honestly say Zara is my favourite place to shop.,5
2022,The customer service sucks big time!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot return my order and even if i could I am not even sure whether they'll refund back my money or not. They don't know how to solve the matter they will always make a mistake one way or the other and don't even get me started on their attitude they are sooooo rude. Never expected this from a global brand. I am done shopping at Zara. Please improve your customer service Zara India!!!,1

Nah I clicked on that one to see it, not the next one, can't chill in bed at weird angles and just swipe, always either moving down the page or to next",1

2022,"zara the place to shop, Quality well-made clothes",5
2022,"Wow.. utterly terrible. Unintuitive, poorly designed, clunky. I would say use the website.. but that is awful too.. I did order some clothes, but it took an age, even though I knew exactly what I wanted. I'm not really sure the developers know what they are doing. Let's hope the clothes are better than the app!",1
2022,good quality,5
2022,👍🏾,5
2022,Annoying that items out of stock are still shown and there isn't an option to not see them.,2

2022,l love Zara,5
2022,Gorgeous clothes as always,5
2022,ZARA shall have enough money to hire some capable IT to make this app works better and without lots of bugs. As well as shall have enough money to training a professional customer services team. Not just solve problems / answer questions by copy paste.,1
2022,Have tried so many time to change the country from USA to Canada but it doesn't let me and there is no dame option it's so frustrating,1
2022,I like it...makes it fun to shop,5
2022,What is the point of announcing an early sale on the app if you can't even log in?! Log in details work fine on the site but the app says there is a problem. Useless.,1
2022,"I love zara and buy there all the time but I had to write this review because every time I open their app I get annoyed. It's is not user friendly at all! Scrolling though the pictures of the item has to be just perfect else it goes to the description part, home page is like I'm trying to solve a riddle to find a category and the MOST ANNOYING thing are their ""artistic "" pictures of models in such distorted poses I have no clue how the clothes fits or if their bones are in one piece🤦🏻‍♀️",2
2022,Still can't log in. App still keeps showing errors!,1

2022,"The app has some bugs. For example, when I click on the pictures under ""view similar items"", the picture next to it opens up instead. Or, sometimes, some of the items' pictures don't load at all (the whole screen remains blank when I click on the item).",4
2022,I love zara always the material is so good but what I hate in zara is in store shopping there's no trolleys or shopping bags.,4
2022,"I can't sign in. It tells sg. went wrong try again later. I uninstalled,doesn't solved problem.",1

2022,"It's too difficult to find plus sizes. The layout is a learning curve. The sale items is mixed in. So, if there's a sale going on, you wouldn't know.",1
2022,UI is not convenient to use,2
2022,The gallery of the outfits on the models are very 👎bad,1
2022,Good,4
2022,Cannot return. Worst customer care,1
2022,Bad,1
2022,"After the update a couple of months ago (?), viewing pictures once you click on an item has become a nightmare. There's a swipe up/down motion to go through them, which often brings up the details about the item by accident. It also doesn't take much for the app to think you swiped left or right, switching to another item. It's over sensitive and too easy for it to do stuff you don't want to. It's become so annoying I use the app less, especially for browsing.",1
2022,"Love the interface of the app. The only UX issue I am having is on the product details page. When you scroll up to see other photos on the vertical carousel, it triggers the related products pull up card often which is not what I want to do. It's a little annoying.",5

2022,exchange of size shud be started,5
2022,"app is great but but yes definitely Zara make people stupid. The reason I have added stuff in the cart which clearly shows in stock but as soon as sale started n I try to paid, put of 8 item 6 out of stock like within 2 minutes seriously.",1
2022,"Shopping at Zara since they open here in Toronto, love the styles, reasonably priced. Caters to men, women, children, even something for your home. Great 2x yearly sales, if you can wait for it, that is?!!Otherwise, even with no sales, it is so reasonably priced, great up-to-date fashion styles for everyone. Highly recommend this store to anyone of all different age groups.",5

2022,Poor app performance lately!! It's been such a hassle to use the ZARA online shopping app in the past several months that I switched to the website.,2
2022,Needs an update every other week or it will not give me a drop down menu,3
2022,the most important thing is that this app doesn't send notifications to users that often. easy to use app,5

2022,"When I check the sizes and colours, it doesn't find what I checked. Eg. I check only items in size 38EUR and it gives me a bunch of things that are not available in 38. Or the same thing in colour. I check black, and it gives every single colour as if I didn't check anything at all.",2

2022,Worst in return proces,1
2022,"Such a trash app. Viewing things and going back to previous page will take you back to the initial state, not where you last were. Items only show out of stock once you're in the process of payment. Can't believe this is acceptable. Horrible application that is not user friendly at all.",2

2022,Nice collection 👌,4
2022,"Absolutely nightmarish UI, completely overloaded, the same item gets shown multiple times, scrolling requires skill and experience because there is about 15 different ways... Much like the offered products, it's all about looks and no thought given to the user-friendliness and comfort.",2

2022,Not seeling perfume,1
2022,it hangs,4
2022,"Annoying amount of constant lagging and freezing while scrolling. Scrolling down at the item photos makes that pesky bar pop-up with the item details, which is even more annoying. And the filtering in ""search"" is useless. What a dumb app.",2
2022,Excellent,5
2022,"very slow after few pages of scrolling. UX is bad when trying to scroll over the pictures of an item, ends up always opening the details",1

2022,"Didn't expect this from zara. They really have to worked on smoothes of clicks and scrolls. You click somewhere else and they shows something else to you. The zoom in picture and pictures or items are really bad. I hate their shopping experience, it makes you frustated. At first I thought it's just me I'm not clicking on it properly, but it happened like 50 times. You can't be just the leader in market and have shittest experience for users.",1
2022,good,5

2022,"First time writing a review for an app, and I'm doing it because it's really frustrating to use the app now - in many ways. Perhaps the app developer can test out from an user end from start to finish to know what I mean. Some examples include kicking me off the page when I'm browsing through the pictures, and when inserting address to check out, it gives me the option to click on the preset address but when I do, it doesnt set the full address - instead it only displays the street name.",1

2022,easy...,5
2022,This has happened a couple of times now. Before I place the order it says it will be available for collection between 27th-28th. Then after I make the payment it says available for collection between 27th-31st. I didn't want the order after the 28th! I would not have ordered it if it was not available until then.,1

2022,really cute selections!,5
2022,"the site is easy to make purchases with once you find the items, but selecting the item size and quantity is unnecessarily hidden. It seems like they're trying to hard to be different with that step. you have to add items to the cart to get to the size/qty selection and then hyperlinked under that is a size guide. Its uncommon for sure...if that's what they were going for. Once you figure out how to order, everything else is easy.",5

2022,Lv zara,5
2022,"Love many Zara items, good quality and high street fashion and trends but you could have more offers and more payment methods so it gives us more flexibility. I use Clearpay and Klarna very often and it's an amazing way to shop and have cash flow in the same time so you don't end up with your money stuck all at once.",4
2022,wouldn't recognize my Irish eircode,1
2022,"Honestly I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I live in Ireland so we always have delayed shipping, but i still got my order relatively fast and the customer service was so sweet and helpful when I did have to contact them. At first the layout and use of the app is very awkward and difficult but once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing. And I have yet to recieve a bad order, and i love their perfumes. Also no ads or anything, which is a lot considering other apps. 5/5 stars",5

2022,"Poor Customer service The customer service agents are rude and useless. They talk like a robot and do not even acknowledge the customers query or issue. They don't care if you don't get your package on time simply blames the customer. Doesn't take the responsibility. Didn't expected this. I am never going to order anything from this useless app. And ""expensive doesn't mean good quality or product"" this is what Zara has taught me.",1

The worse part is evey employee seems insane and they give the same answer. Such a shameful thing for a Brand, they've miserably failed to deliver customer service.

2022,Love love love this app! It allows you to store favourite items for future purchase (as long as your size hasn't sold out) and if you like an item that doesn't have your size it will let you know when it comes in stock. Also has a scanning device that you can use instore for an item you can purchase online if it is out of stock in the store! I wish more shops had this facility. Downside - I spend too much money on it! 😂,5

2022,It's not what I was hoping 😕,1
2022,Don't support our region,1
2022,Better than shopping via website which is confusing AF. But this app stll needs work... Not very intuitive e.g. why does the menu come up blank? Why do I have to swipe UP to view more images of a product? Not sure the developers did any proper UAT.,3
2022,Best of the best,5
2022,"I absolutely hate clicking on a product, and wanting to swipe up to see more images of the product, but the options bar pulling up almost every time.

2022,I have my Samsung z flip 3..this app doesn't work perfect with it..I have android 12,1
2022,Too 'edgy'. It's hard to see dark clothes because of how they photograph them. To view images on a product you swipe up...but that's also the same gesture to view the item description. I cannot even view the product images because despite swiping from the middle of my screen the description still comes up. I appreciate how innovative the design of the app is but it's too much.,2
2022,"Bye-bye, Zara, you became a political tool",1

I had to go & find all of the products and re-add them all to my (now logged-in) basket. Tried to check out again and I keep getting an error and having the app sign me out every time I tried to purchase. Do you guys not want my money or something?",1

2022,Good app,5
2022,This app is always broken!!,2
2022,This app is a scam. This is the second time this has happened to me. Returned an order and got an email from ZARA saying that the items returned are not their products. All the products returned had the tags on and definitely had their labels too. This doesn't happen with any other brand. They come up with all sorts of made up issues to not refund ur money nor do they return the products,1

2022,"Worst experience ever. Do not place an order from Zara india if you don't want to waste your time in calling them every 3 days for them to pickup your order. I placed a return request on 25th Jan 22,and the order still hasn't been picked up (16th Feb 22). Pathetic customer service. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. And stop deleting customer's reviews zara,take the feedback and improve your BELOW AVERAGE services. This is the second time I'm posting this review. I have never had a more pathetic service.",1

2022,Very bad experience while returning the product . Return button is not there nor any return request form,1
2022,"While going through 'PURCHASES', every time software directs to the last purchase once you scroll the purchase of any date.

2022,Worst experience..u should have work on ur return policy .only msg come for return conformation but no one came to pick return order .,1
2022,"Worst update put back the old version !!!! I dont understand why you always trying to upgrade something but it's actually a downgrade, way too many step to go to the wishlist, and while you going into an item, its send you all the way to the begging of your wishlist which is really annoying. Honestly the app is really really bad and it doesn't make you want to order",1
2022,"Slow, full of bugs,dislike",1
2022,Good,4
2022,After adding items when I go to cart to buy it always shows out of stock really irritating selecting everything and at the end it shows out of stock,1
2022,"They do not return the delivery charges, where H&M, Myntra, Ajio, Flipkart they call return the amount. Even after the product are not of proper fitting the do not return the amount, Never ever going to purchase from Zara again. Disappointed. H&M is better.",1
2022,Return policy is the worst. I have not received my refund yet.,1
2022,"The app is ok if you only want to browse stuff and make a purchase quickly, otherwise it's pretty redundant. You can't chat, you can't do curbside pick-up, you can't notify the store to have your online order ready when you are close to the store, you can't do detailed tracking, you can't amend and in-store availability is inaccurate and lacking. Even if you have the app, you still need to manually 1) call 2) walk to the store 3) stand in line 4) use fedex tracking 5) chat using website (usually a dead-end). Customer service is non-existent and if your order gets lost or delayed - well, you SOL. Zara is cheap for a reason.",1

2022,The latest update îs the worst nightmare when it comes to app shopping and I do not understand why the team that worked on this update hates consumers so much. Please do something and revert to the old version which was more user friendly than this s**t. Thanks,1
2022,"Everything was great until the latest update, I am unable to login. I have to use the web browser. Please fix that.",4
2022,Products are good but only size issue. I am very dissapointed when they sent me a stained dress and when returned refuse to refund me blaming me of sending back used item😡😡,2
2022,Really frustrated by asking for followups from the department. They display items that are already sold out ..... and I don't know what delivery agents they have hired who just won't contact you and return items on your behalf.,1
2022,Worst customer service ..ever compare to any other app.,1
2022,Return and refund policies are very bad and unexpected.,1

2022,Superb products,5
2022,Awesome,5
2022,It was very good,1
2022,Worst app and i guess worst strategy for fake engagement on their app. Just playing with the minds of indians with the sale. Its just a hoax.,1

2022,This app and brand is amazing.....loved it.....I ordered a pair of shoes and just got it in the estimated time period.....no late delivery issue....although I am from the city or infact my state doesnt have zara store....so i was having trust issues.....but i purchased and i dont know why there are so many negative reviews about late delivery and about the app.....but I will say that it is a big brand and you can trust it.,5
2022,Best app,5
2022,"Worst 👎 app zara.. There are so many problem that one has to faced through, size issues as the given size on app is completely different and the return policy is a headache, customer service sucks as they would always mention with email that the return will be pick by courier within 24-48 hours. But there is no return pickup from courier at all, even after going to the courier office whether they have received any message on their system, the answer would be no.Return policy is hell 🤯🤯",1
2022,Filter is not retained while browsing through the items.,1
2022,Top returned and no refund. Customer service is pathetic.,1
2022,"I've had such a bad experience shopping online, I wanted to place a return and it's not getting picked up. It's been 3 weeks. The customer support is awful. I've tried contacting them in all possible ways.",1

2022,Not sure,5
2022,"Unbelievable none of the items have no dimensions under item info! How am I supposed to know if that carpet fits in the toilette or grand living room?! A storage box is huge or tiny? Not even shown with other images to compare, this is useless. Search gives weird, irrelevant results. Some item photos just show models' faces. Did you try using your own app one day? I guess not.",2
2022,I have ordered a perfume costs 1500 and It got canceled by itself .. no refund received till now and when I ask customer service to call me back or text the response is really pathetic There is no response.,1

2022,"The new update is awful. It makes it to much difficult to shop from the app. You can not even set filters as when you tap on a product and go back, it reset all your filters. Further the option to pick it up from a shop is not working. Finally generally is the worse update I have ever see in a app.",1
2022,very smart app,5
2022,This app is a BIGGGG scam . I placed an order since December my card was charged and everytime I emailed about order they never reply,1
2022,Best app where u can find whtever u want .,5
2022,TS funny I see all these reviews and I wonder if this is the same Zara app I use or another ? Zara clothes are my go to brand anyday and the customer service if great. Offered to return my money when I couldn't see one of my item at the drop point. (Hopefully it should be there tomorrow ) the only but I have is it doesn't show tracking number (only order number )...all the same way to go Zara,5
2022,The clothes so good,5
2022,تطزويب,5
2022,I ordered a pair of shoes... It was a gift and I was counting on their good reputation but contrary to that... I get an email on the last day of expected delivery period that due to some unknown reasons it's been delayed and was provided another delivery period. And after all this... On the second last day of second delivery period when I checked the app... It says the order has been cancelled without any emails any calls. It was my very first purchase from Zara and it was not at all a good one.,1
2022,Good App,5
2022,Seen some improvements,4
2022,"Very disappointed with the product I have purchased online through Zara App. The item I received was a second hand, It was already been worn by someone, it was very dirty in color area and on the hems of the sleeves . Also the jacket was stinking badly.",1

2022,"My review is based on the new update. I used to love this app but now it makes it so hard to navigate between your wishlist and your shopping bag, although it's in one place now the app freezes when going from wishlist to shopping bag and vice versa. Also when I finally add something to my shopping bag it says that there's nothing in there. The customer service is also really bad as the chat cuts off after 5 mins. Please go back to the old layout.",1
2022,👏🎉,5
2022,"WTH,so pricey than SHEIN and those ugly necklaces its not even worthy",1
2022,Works really good now,4
2022,"Everytime I opened the box it never fail to make me smile. I know sometimes the sizes are different but it all depend on the style, you have to know your body.

2022,"I have purchased 2 items, 1 was missing and u guys saying it's my fault. After so many exchange of emails u guys said I will not receive any refund. Just not at all happy after so many purchase I did in year's from zara that's how u will treat ur customer. Not my fault ur boxes are thin as a paper that it is easily torn down and somebody took the items from it. It was my last purchase from you. No more zara ever and gonna uninstall the app and never gonna recommend it to anyone. I hate zara",1

2022,Nice,5
2022,"The wishlist page is NOT USER FRIENDLY! I appreciate you want to update to improve, but why change something that didn't need to be fixed! You can't scroll to see other items in your wishlist, as you have to constantly click in and out to add items, and then it automatically takes you back to the beginning of your list, which at that point you give up. It was also easier to see and manage the items you saved without the carousel plugin feature.",1
2022,Doesn't open and gets stuck,3
2022,"Poorly built app, sluggish animations, not responding inputs. Couldn't even go through the registration. So, I didn't get the chance to experience with the rest. There are WeChat mini apps which performs much better than this and this is a native mobile app. I don't know how could any senior developer would have approved such an app for a release. Just a suggestion as a developer, users don't care about fancy sliding/fading screens, they care about stability, ease of use and navigation.",1

2022,I love this app,3
2022,Optimum clothes,5
2022,Such a pathetic experience with zara online service. I have been waiting from last 20 days for my return products to be picked. I complained thrice and every time i have to give the same information. The customer care is not helpful at all they will keep you waiting and take ages to reply. I raised the return request thrice and there is no sign of any information.,1

2022,STILL LOVE THIS APP NEVER HAD A PROBLEM,5
2022,"Are the app developers reading any recent reviews? Is someone working on fixing it? The recent update is crashing the app and giving a message that the mobile app is potentially harmful and needs to be removed, would be great if it gets fixed.",1

2022,"Its a great app. I have received my order within 6 days of purchase. Pick up next day itself and a refund within next 6 days. During sales, its really difficult to get the most needed clothes. It frequently keeps getting out of stock. Kindly look on this. Also reduce the minimum order price of ₹2999. Just have to keep buying unnecessary everytime. Another good thing to add is exchange facility.",4

2022,"Overall very easy to navigate. A constructive feedback: There are saved items which are out of stock but still show in saved section, which is confusing and time consuming. If possible to remove them automatically would be great.",4
2022,Happy,4
2022,Avg app,3
2022,Perfect,5
2022,Excellent 👍,5
2022,LOVE THISSS!!Got new boooootttsss,5
2022,Amazing collection and easy to use,5
2022,Very good,5
2022,App and the company sucks.,1
2022,I love love love and love this app,5
2022,Good,4
2022,Update the app without reading the reviews...I know my bad. The changes made had gone from perfectly alright app to worse. The navigation is so difficult. Wishlist short moved to basket. Cant swipe left or right to check ur different purchases like u use to. It really gave me a headache in 5min of searching. Uninstalled the updated version and went back to 10.49.0 version and a relief.,1
2022,No thx,5
2022,"Previous version of wishlist is much more user friendly, this one si wide so you can't see all products at once and it throws you back on first item when you open one product.",1
2022,Superb...,5
2022,🥺👉👈,5
2022,Massive room for improvement. No point in having an aesthetic on the app if the app itself is poor at best. Your Chat function cuts the chat off when the AI determines it has answered (when it hasn't) the query- not sophisticated at all.,2
2022,👍🏻,5
2022,My favourite shopping app...Everthing is fine...& fast delivery,5
2022,Refund issue. 😶,1
2022,"Awesome product plus fast delivery, job well done",5

2022,Sos far so good. User friendly and easy. I like the new 3D feature.,5
2022,Amazing ❤❤❤,5
2022,One of the worst user interface. You don't justify being an elite brand. The customer service won't ever respond. The app is extremely slow.,1
2022,the products are undoubtedly very good but they have the worst customer support of all time.. they use the same tactic every time with everyone,3
2022,Love Zara❤️,5
2022,Nice 👍,5
2022,Very visually appealing app. Clean layout and easy to navigate.,5
2022,Most pathetic aap. There is no simple way to talk to customer care. Those who reply in chat are not bothered about anything nd dont reply properly.,1
2022,Amazing,5
2022,"Since the day I got to know about Zara, I haven't really shopped anywhere else.",5

2022,Horrible!!!,1
2022,"No wishlist, the new update is horrible. Dont do it ! Hope they will do another update when they bring back the saved items... This is making me leave and never purchase again!",1
2022,Great experience,4
2022,Nice 😊,5
2022,"Great, user-friendly.",5
2022,Amazing,5
2022,"39 App is good, product quality is okay too, but I received a clothing which was worn by someone from at least 2 weeks and they sent it back to zara after damaging it and they sent it to me without checking that the quality of the jacket was bad, there were no price tags or protective coverings on it, stitching was coming undone in many places. I've been a loyal customer of zara and this experience was really bad for me.",1
2022,Love it!!!,5
2022,Bad user experience with no proper customer support. I really wish zara improves their customer support experience and make it more user friendly.,2

2022,"I am frustrated with a refund that I've not received yet and trying to connect an agent since past 2 days....no fate yet with a ""human"" agent, only the chatbot that keept me on hold forever then got disconnected. Why Zara why?? I miss the service I used to get in 2018-2019",1
2022,Refunded items aren't shown.,1
2022,Ok,5
2022,"Pathetic app and customer support, they won't pick up a product meant for return, ask you to call them for atleast 3 times and give details each time and register return and yet no pick up! They even sent wrong product and then same 3 times register process was to be repeated for the return of their misrake! And same story of no pick up",1
2022,Thanks for updating ur app. It really. Sucked . I hope it works better now,5
2022,Amazing shoping online in Sarajevo City.,5
2022,"This app frustrates me. Every after 2 days, I can't add to my cart or login using my details. I don't know how many times it rejected my login details. Zara can do better than this, really.",2
2022,Good,5
2022,Wonderful application,5
2022,The app is useful,5
2022,"This is a great ap you don't have to go to the store, you can get any product you want with the touch of a finger, and one plus point is that in stores you don't then get all products.",5
2022,Zara is good for me,5
2022,"I agree, the app is great once you get used to the layout you can find everything. The only niggle I would have is if you have an item saved for later in your basket and it goes out of stock it seems you are unable to delete it but,it doesn't stop me from buying from it! Great customer service and prompt postage quicker than our domestic.",5
2022,Nice,5
2022,Probably the best Store apps ever! Others don't even come close to it!,5
2022,Awesome,5
2022,Awful and annoying new layout.,1

2022,"Great service, quality products 10/10.",5
2022,"Worst online shopping ever no one is care to follow your order, I made a big one and I paid for it from more than 10 days till now I didn't receive it and no one is asking about the order and the email for online customer service is not working",1
2022,Very bad experience Order delivered after one month.,1
2022,Cant update,1
2022,Worst Customer support. No way to get in touch with them Chat has no replies,1
2022,I'm in Spain. I want access to Zara ESPAÑA in Spanish and prices listed in Euros. The App will not allow me access using Español or list priced in Euros. FRUSTRATED,2
2022,Terrible...purchase items ...delivery is always delayed,1
2022,"Da takav brend sebi dopusti da iznos od 10.000rsd ne vraca vise od mesec dana, i da kao odgovor njihov meni salju da su oni meni uplatili novac(iako nisu) je u rangu stranica sto prave kopije marki. Da Bog da propali, znaju da uzmu pare, a ne znaju nista kad trebaju da vrate! 🔥",1
2022,My online purchase was straight forward and i received the item on time😘👌🏽,5

2022,I cant log in for a few days now. Tried uni stalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesnt seem to work,2
2022,سئ جدا وخدمة الشات لا يقوم بحل المشكلة,1
2022,Cannot put in shipping details as app does not respond!,1
2022,Along with the email. Zara customers should be able to see the items returns in purchased history. I like that they are pictures to the item such easier when returning items. Also we the new app where is the favourite? The old design was actually better. Bring back the favourite folder.,3
2022,I have placed 4 orders during sale.. still haven't received the same 😡 and the status is showing shipped. Totally disappointed and it spoiled my birthday mood too... these kinda things from a reputed brand is awful. There is no proper way to get in touch with customer care and get the tracking details.,1
2022,Don't purchase online...They did not give response via chat..even bluedart service for pick up is so pathetic..I get everyday messages for pickup but nobody come to pick up..I ll give zero this app...I never buy again from this app..,1
2022,I was putting the items in the basket but we I left it over I day suddenly disappear please this problem,1
2022,Bhut bura app,1
2022,The app constantly resets filters of search.,2
2022,Unfortunately i,3
2022,"The recent changes to this app is awful. The wishlist is long winded to navigate. Once you click on a saved item, you can't scroll left and right to see the rest of the list like you used to. You have to come out of that page, and go back to the wishlist, which has automatically scrolled back to the first item each time. Therefore, if you want to check your whole wishlist, the process is a time waster Absolutely non user friendly, and seems to have taken a step back rather than any improvement.",1
2022,Never update the others. It's awfull,2
2022,The app keep stopping and close by itself while I tried to check or browse the item on the app. Not recommend.,1
2022,The pictures make sure that nobody can see the clothes. Horrible!,1

2022,I received an alert on my phone saying the app is infected. Deleted it immediately...,1
2022,Your parcel never reach on date,1
2022,"The last update has made it so much more difficult to buy anything from the app. The Wishlist is made in a way that you scroll through the items,look at one in particular,and once you go back you need to scroll from the first item again. Also the other features are much more complicated now. The app was better the way it was.",1
2022,"No problem with the app so far but today I got an alert saying ""Zara app appears infected, immediate unistallation is advised"". Did this happen to anyone else?",3
2022,Too many bugs on the app Everything is literally out of stock and when something comes in stock not able to add in cart... Worst shopping experience,1
2022,Great,5
2022,"In my opinion they don't use RecyclerView because when I scrolled down the memory is overflowed and threw out from the app. So just a friendly reminder dear developers, please don't use Listview! (just Google it why RecyclerView usage is a better practice than the Lisview) Thank you, if u read it dev team!",1
2022,Flagged up as having a virus so deleted. Was not the easiest app to use - tended to just go on the website on laptop to make purchases as easier to browse. Style over substance.,2
2022,This app might be infected with a virus. Got a pop message saying this app was infected with a virus and to uninstall app,1
2022,"""Security threat. ZARA appears to be infected. Immediate uninstallation is advised.""",3
2022,"This is more of a reach out to the development team, my phone detected some sort of virus within the app and advised to remove it immediately.

2022,"Changed my phone and as a result I couldn't get into my account, so naturally I tried to reset my password as I thought it was my fault. Well not exactly. I couldn't reset it via the app for the life of me, the promised mail never got into my mailbox. I did manage via the website, also hard because of the app, and then the new password is not accepted by the app. That's absurd. Before you ask,yes,I have the latest version installed.",1
2022,best quality products,5
2022,3 star for the brand. Please reduce the delivery shipment cost. 300 is too much for a shipment. Anyone can buy a tshirt for that cost. Please do something for the out of stock problem too. Thankyou.,3

2022,"Clean and in order, easy to use",5
2022,"Departments I want to shop in are simply not working when I click on the link. Categories include Knitwear, Lengerie, puffer coats, etc. Please fix :(",1
2022,Used to be good app but now is very confused and doesn't know how to browse.,2
2022,"A useless app. You cannot use your password so you cannot pay for your items in the basket. You change your password, and was told that they sent a message to your email, and nothing. Zara, you need to get your act together.",1
2022,"Worst service, its been 13 days i haven't got my refund and whenever i try to enquire about my return/refund it shows app is not responding. And also there is no separate space for your return items detail and refund details.",1
2022,Nice,5
2022,There is no proper way to get in touch with customer care through the app. Those who reply on chat are least bothered. My order was cancelled by Zara and only the cost of the item was refunded. Delivery charges were pocketed by Zara. Customer care has no idea of why the order was cancelled or why the delivery charges was not refunded.,1
2022,Trash customer service.,1
2022,"App is good, product quality is okay too, but I received a clothing which was worn by someone from at least 2 weeks and they sent it back to zara after damaging it and they sent it to me without checking that the quality of the jacket was bad, there were no price tags or protective coverings on it, stitching was coming undone in many places.

2022,"Terrible app, I bought items within the app, after a few days neither my wife nor I can login to our accounts, it says both our details don't match. Unable to reset password either. I have deleted the app. Now I can not login on website either. Worse than one star",1
2022,Worst app ever. Especially the pics,1
2022,Quality of product is too good and very fast delivery. Fully satisfied with this app.,5
2022,"Worst app ever. Items go out of stock, stock not updated, results show items out of stock. Overall experience is frustrating.",1
2022,"Worst customer service. Also, they don't send any notification if they couldn't deliver the product.",1
2022,Good,5
2022,"Um lixo, voce nao consegue entrar na sua conta, sempre da erro, não consegue acessar sua aba de pedidos, não consegue salvar nenhum item, mesmo tendo essa opção, você clica e não salva nada. O aplicativo costumava funcionar super bem e agora não serve para nada.",1
2022,"The worst app and customer services . I'm trying to return some items and once I click on the' return ' it deletes all the selected items and restarts . I've tried it 5 times and have a lot to return. No luck. The chat servise sucks,they dudnt respond, phone customer agent was way too slow to sort it and the line cut off or she just hang up on me. Absolutely terrible experience",1
2022,Everything is fine but the customer service sucks the life out of me. it is literally so irritating how nobody replies. Hire more people if you need.,1
2022,Very fraudulent app..guyzz don't purchase anything from them,1
2022,Always a pleasure,5
2022,One of the easiest fashion app ive used! Great customer service from live chat. Easy and reliable!,5
2022,Worst customer service The customer service is not at all helpful. They say wait for a moment and everyone vanishes . There is never a solution provided by their team.,2
2022,Tried to buy a few things from the app but it doesn't even register me after several trials also.,1
2022,Good,5
2022,It's good,5
2022,I love Zara but their Cust service sucks.,3
2022,Go for it.,5
2022,Very Bad Company with bad customer service False offers and false products with high prices Wasted money and time,1
2022,Wouldn't buy anything from this store as I bought jeans from here and the zippers break easy I would order try them on and the zipper would break... I called the store about this they happily replace the first pair then the second did the same thing just by trying them on. Pretty well stole my money total of 195 worth of jeans. Since then I tried to call the store right after I opened the package and tried them on they said that there was nothing they could do for me... really sad.,1
2022,Wish zara s app was just easy a d simple,1
2022,Soo nice app I love it,5

2022,Its not customer friendly.,1
2022,Zara's online service sucks..I purchased an item online from the 3rd of January till today I never received it..apparently I was supposed to get it on the 12th and there's no feedback,1
2022,Fab delivery always quick and very good on trying to get u notification on when the item us coming back on sale,5

2022,"Lately I have trouble accessing my account which means I'm not buying clothes I like from you. But, if that's what Zara wants, I don't have time for it",5
2022,This app is so good,5
2022,The drop point option is often down so you can't pick that option.,1
2022,Amazing😍🤩,5
2022,You are just begging for your own money because customare care is cluless about everything regarding your return and refund orders...,1
2022,"Amazing app, so versatile and easy to use. Everything available at your fingertips. 100% best retail app available. ♥️ Zara",5
2022,"Good product, bad service. Order was paid and shipped then suddenly got cancelled and product returned without my consent . Unable to find items in the app for repurchase .

2022,Cool,5
2022,No wishlist when using browser . I couldnt download it on my old phone so the browser was the only option . But apparently i needed to search again my saved products,1
2022,Terrible .... Inspite of paying for the product not delivery also impossible to track the product . No contact can be established with the Zara team . Please do not make any purchases through the app .,1
2022,Fabulous online app every zara products are awesome.,5

2022,Horrible...on normal days everything is out of stock or coming soon and today on sale I entered the app once the sale started and all items in the shopping cart became unavailable. I entered as 10pm sharp. No credibility at all...plus they removed the check store availability option. After 5 minutes from the sale there were zero items on online app and no option to filter by size availability...what a waste of time!,1
2022,Can't do much with it. Returns tab doesn't work,1
2022,Not good at all dosent show products,2
2022,Este app es muy bueno de Zara me ha gustado mucho su servicio 👌,5
2022,Amazing service n love all the ZARA products....!!!!,5
2022,"Terrible experience with Zara for the first time. Most importantly, they don't have customer care number. The chat just keeps expiring. I've been delivered the wrong products and there's nothing I can do about it.",2
2022,Its not user friendly,1
2022,"worst application, Zara is such a good brand please get a better application. It lags and your costumer service is like helll no response .",1
2022,Their chat support is bad. And the refund policy is the worst. They don't care about the Coustmers.,1
2022,No way to contact customer care.....it's very very horrible.... Better to go in the store only ...you will never be able to contact customer care of something goes wrong ... horrible,1
2022,"I love zara but size is just a problem, pants and jeans are too long, even xs sometimes are too small for my waist, and for blouses or dresses too much cleavage",4

2022,Exceptional,5
2022,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,1
2022,Amazing,5
2022,I visit the app at least once a week for ideas etc. The orders arrive quickly and the return process is very simple ( no printer needed) . Also yhe items a packaged beautifully 😍,4
2022,Very nice app my favourite user friendly,5
2022,Very bad experience,1
2022,Great,5
2022,"Absolutely useless app. You can't update your personal details, website you cannot login because straight away you get log out for inactivity. Search never find anything you are looking for even they sell it. It's impossible to shop, because you cannot fill details. What a Micky Mouse software designer :-(",1
2022,User friendly,5
2022,"Pido algo en rebajas y resulta que me cobran despues de unos dias a precio entero,cuando incluso en la tienda fisica esta rebajado el mismo articulo.y tengo ademas que ir a recogerlo .una estafa .Lo he devuelto y no voy a usar mas la app",1
2022,"The most pathetic app I have see. They will show items are available and when you go to pay you will get a message that some items are not available, but they won't tell which ones are not available if you have more than one in your cart. Their customer service is a joke with bunch of unprofessional and clueless executives who cannot answer a single query or help with any issues",1
2022,Excellent application,4
2022,Poor app..i canceled my order but they dont give refund,1
2022,Not good,1

2022,Just 1 or 2 orders sometimes didnt show up on my Zara app then they showed up delayed besides that app works excellently SO FAR!,5
2022,"Great layout and user interface in my opinion, easy to find what you're looking for or just browse. My 2-star rating, however, is a result of maybe what's only been an issue for me. The app will not let me add anything to my basket. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the issue persists and is really irritating as I then need to go onto my laptop if I actually want to buy anything and find the individual items AGAIN.",2
2022,"Great app for shopping but brutal for returns. Every time I start a return it never emails me my shipping label. Every time, I have to contact customer care to get this re-sent to me and it's such a hassle. They ask me for my order number, email address, tell me that they already sent me the label and I said I never received it, then they make me verify who I am before resending the label. Complete hassle. This process really needed to be fixed.",2
2022,Great app,5
2022,Please mark the sold out items.,3
2022,Zara is Extremely Fine And Costly too but not for all,5
2022,"Worst customer service experience, support executive asked to wait and left chat unanswered mostly. Issue is not resolved shared all proofs.",1
2022,It cancels the orders. Don't waste your time,1
2022,Valid login credentials not accepted,3
2022,Worst app don't buy prepaid stuff. They wil not ship your product for month and I still did'nt got my money back. If there were zero stars I would most probably select that.,1
2022,It's amazing.,5
2022,The app is very glitzy. Muddle of the browser it will shut down,3
2022,Too good,5

2022,"Takes time to update ""Out of Stock"" if Adding last available product to the bag and it's already sold during this action. This happened during sale may be due to hight traffic on application. Developers Fix this.",4

Also I think there should be a dark mode option. I know they must you guys must have thought that you should go with the white theme as your store, However it is really straining my eyes which means less time spent on app which means ...",2

The jacket was for 3000/- and the pant was for 2000/- I hardly wore them 4 times and the leather has started to crack. Moreover, the company is not taking any responsibility for the quality of the product and not telling the proper measures to keep the product safe. Not at all happy",1

2022,Very good collection,5

Very bad experience as the app shows that the my size is available in more than store and after going to most of them i realized that the product is not available in all of the stores. If Zara cannot manage or update ana app so they must deactivate it.",1

2021,"I wa trying to reach Zara online support for more than a month and a half now - there was some mistake in registering the delivery. I returned the dress to Sarajevo shop and was trying to get in touch with the support team ever since for the reimboursement as it was not possible to do it in the shop. After 3 visits to the shop in Sarajevo City Centre, firm promises that the service would contact me - nothing yet. The app is not functional, chat is not working and no back up contact email.",1

2021,Zero tried several times to order and goes through all the steps and then indicates it does not match the details. MAKE improvements to your app it is not user friendly and orders take far too long and items that appear online avaible are not always as it seems.,1

2021,Not accurate,1

2021,Difficulty trying to log in. Tried several times to change password but kept saying I had timed out. Not worth the effort😠,1
2021,"Dreadful. I can't understand how a company of this size can create such a terrible app and cannot recommend enough that you do not bother to download this. From struggling to add items to the cart, inability to edit said cart, blank screens and empty error messages and complete impossibility of actually making a purchase on this e-commerce app make it absolutely laughable. An embarrassment all round. A bit like Zara's most recent seasons tbh",1
2021,"Doesn't load.. Can open shopping bag, can't buy products. Irritating",1

2021,"Terrible load speeds, buttons don't function. Reall poor experience.",2
2021,"Terrible app, not user friendly. Crashes and empties your basket when it's full",1
2021,Nothing is loading with the new update. Hopefully it is fixed soon before the big sale.,2
2021,Made me download the app to buy as website down until 9pm but I couldn't register an account until 8pm when the sale started and by the time I tried to buy the item it was out of stock. Waste of time.,1
2021,Ridiculous app. Tried to create an account and it wouldn't let me type in any details! Completely useless. Why do you have to create an account just to buy a few clothes anyway? You should amend the app to shop as a guest. I am uninstalling the app and using the website. Sort it out Zara your app is shocking.,1

2021,Not my cup of tea.,1

2021,Well the way ZARA caters to the needs of its customers and the super easy return and exchange policy and always on point in terms of latest and trendy fashion and affordability makes it a super cool and fantastic brand. I can go on and on.Love you ZARA.,5

2021,Cannot pay thru this f apps. Better uninstall,3
2021,Very nice experience with this app,5
2021,Error 존많,1
2021,A reputed brand with daylight robbery. I bought a product which charged me with delivery fee of 290 rupees. Without my consent they cancelled my order and refunded only the product amount. I will be okay even if they don't refund the delivery fee if I was the one who cancelled the order. I think they should first let the customers know if I want to cancel the order. Not buying again from this brand.,1
2021,Superb,5
2021,Clothes I ordered came in very bad shape. Very poor service,1
2021,Top class quality guaranteed,5
2021,"If I could give this app a zero, I would. I can't believe how, in this day and age, that orders can take SO long to get to you?!? Order placed on 5 Dec... Now delayed to 17 Dec? I won't be ordering on this app again.",1
2021,App is frustrating and disfunctional. Designers have no respect for user experience. Needs total overhaul,1
2021,Convenience on your fingertips,5
2021,Bad service,1
2021,Return service is extremely extremely slow. Concerned authorities do not arrive to pick up your package for weeks together & refund takes further few days to process after the package has been picked up.,2
2021,Orders take long to get delivered. I once made an order on a available item. After a week I get an email saying the item is no longer available... how🤔 Sizes are incorrect most specifically on jeans. I would rather walk 5km in 10 minutes than order again from that app,1
2021,Great,5
2021,Not yet,5
2021,"Hopeless app. The items are not that seeable. The only one item I wanted to see only showed one photo no details, no price. I thought if I put it in the cart I would see the price but it doesn't appear in the cart.. Tried putting other things in cart but nothing happened. Useless. I'm surprised a big store like this could run such a poor app. I think the one star rating I gave was too generous,",1
2021,"Think this is the worst website ever. Love Zara shops and clothes but compared with Asos, River Island or Chi Chi London website's, Zara's is below standard.",1
2021,Very frustrating. There is no help option and I cannot for the life of me work out how to change stores to check stock elsewhere. Tried phoning the stores but none answered. Not surprising as they may be too busy at this time of year or just fed up looking for stock for customers like me...,1
2021,Good 👍,5
2021,Cant even get it to install,1
2021,There is some issue on portal as not able to gt the product after making the payment,1

2021,"If i could give a 0 i would. App is on and off for the past 2 weeks, keeps saying something went wrong or service is currently offline. Right now i cant even track my order because of the fault. Really frustrating to be honest. I cant veiw items or add, each time i go into the app items that were able to save are just removed from my basket.",1
2021,Great app and great quality products.,5
2021,My experience has been awesome on the website. I get a few kinks bit for the most part. It works great.,5
2021,I've waited 2 wks for my order only to be told that my main item is sold out. I then requested for the entire order to be cancelled. The online chat is unhelpful& frustrating. I've messaged 3 times and my chat history just gets cleared& you have to start from scratch and repeat yourself all over again. It's like talking to a robot. In the end they wouldn't allow me to cancel. Saying its already been shipped though the status shows Being Prepared. Before I can respond they end chat.Pathetic!!,1
2021,good,5
2021,I ordered on Zara a Jean and a tshirt and I have marked the return for t shirt they said it will take two days atmost still no one has contacted me.,1
2021,So hard to navigate 😂 they really don't want our business,1
2021,"They duplicated the transactions when I made the first order but I let it slip because I thought it was a mistake, then boom they did it again when I made second order so yeah they've a very poor service.",1

2021,Perfect Software,5
2021,"If I could I would give it a -5, this is horrible app and even the costumer service is horrible",1
2021,The app works okay but the service is terrible. I'll never shop online with Zara again. I'm still waiting for a parcel to be delivered which I ordered on the 26th of November. I escalated and asked about it several times but now the date got postponed again. I'm very upset.,1
2021,App is not working. Everytime i open the app it shows connection failure. Not able to access anything.,1
2021,Great app but there is a problem in customer care so if you can improve it then it would be 10 stars .,5
2021,I can't find a flaw of this app. It's easy to use it and the items are well sorted and clearly seen from all angles.,5
2021,Good,3
2021,Terrible service in that you wait forever for your stuff.They need to make a plan so that it works efficiently.By the time your order comes you have forgotten what you bought.Very disappointing 😕,1
2021,I tried ordering an item via this app which took me directly to the payment page without having me selected the address/location. The app is very slow at the same time.,1
2021,Good,4
2021,Good,4

2021,"No dark mode kills me, please implement it! I love zaras collections but the UI still needs refinement. I don't like the fact they call their normal categories collections and it just overcomplicated it. The brightness control option for QR codes can't be turned off again easily and units can't be adjusted when 1 is out of stock so I had to remove both items which can be lost time during a sale.",1

2021,The app works well. Horrible return policy. Zara is more concerned about recovering there losses when they send you the incorrect item then customer service. If they send you the wrong order it is a huge hassle to actually get the item you paid for.,2

Very frustrating I spent hours trying to figure this out and even the assistant talking to me had no answers! Sorry to moan but this was nearly a day trying to sort out! I shall not be using this site in the future.,1

2021,The experience is good but the only problem I'm facing is that when I check out a black product the app oversaturates the black colour and it's pretty much not possible to see the product details in the image.,4
2021,Very very much more awesome,5
2021,Difficult to navigate,3
2021,Very user friendly,5

2021,Awful app,1

2021,Wow,5
2021,Cancels orders,1
2021,My experience with this app was horrible. What a frustrating and very poor service. Your Chat service is a nightmare to say the least. I bought boots for my daughter online and they started peeling off on the second wear. With regard to this my daughter refused to wear them after 5 times of wearing them as they got worse.I expected good quality for my money especially @Zara. Was advised to return them as many people did because they were factory fault. But Chat keeps kicking me out and no help!!,1
2021,Worst Experience ever Its been a month I have ordered items and haven't received yet Neither received any mail.Nor they are giving any updates the customer support is useless they do not even pic the call and chat is of no use.I have already paid for the order but no updates from their side.,1

Tolong diperbaiki krn fitur chat live penting banget kalau ada masalah sama paket/ada pertanyaan, kalau bisa tambahkan jg opsi CS by phone supaya bisa ngomong lgsg ke admin dan lebih cepat dihandle..",1

There is no consistency in your user journeys, so how would you expect anyone to buy anything.? This is 'design' gone horribly wrong I'm afraid. I think the concept must have been a browsable magazine, but frankly it's just a mess. I suspect your mobile website is probably a bit better so am deleting this app. I hope the feedback helps!",1

2021,Best material product,5
2021,"The app is really non-intuitive and difficult to use. The use of space isn't efficient, in an attempt to be stylish I assume? There are a lot of technical fashion words or made up 'Zara' words which means it's hard to find collections and clothes as expected.",2
2021,The app works very slow and also they have worst customer service and app is very poor,1
2021,"It will be better if buyers can add review on the item. Thus, we can have extra information about quality and fix. Besides, the website doesn't show when a item is out of stock",1

2021,"To the Developers: If you do not know how to build a decent shopping app, please quit your jobs and let someone capable do it. Logging in/Registering is a mess and doesn't work most of the time, I add something to the cart, the cart doesn't even open. Also you have to click 3-4 times on the size to add it to the cart.

2021,I would give zero stars if I could. This app is so not user friendly. The design needs to be simplified it takes too long to find things.

2021,"Stopped using it, constantly deletes my wishlist.",2
2021,Big fan of zara n it's handy app....just they need to work more on early refunds....and early reaching to warehouse after return...it's it's biggest drawback,5

2021,Great stuff,4

2021,Zara has no exchange policy if you buy something and it is over 30 days to return they will not allow you to exchange so don't buy any presents for anyone,1
2021,Great,4

2021,"Terrible customer service, no phone number and only on messenger. My order was sent to the wrong address and months before got money back and items were sent back to the wear house and not returned to me",2
2021,I hope you just remove the product once it's not available especially on SALE Items. It's still there but all of the sizes were out of stock. Can you please do that.,3
2021,"Worked for me, I could by from website but the app worked OK. I see a lot negative review for customer service, I didn't have any that because I always return my online stuff at the store near me. If I have to drive to post office to ship things back and wait for the return to go though, night just drive to the store to return it get my money back right away.",5
2021,I cant open it,1
2021,Classic,5
2021,More than amazing,5

2021,The Best !,5
2021,Delays and Stops,2
2021,"I will be as realistic as possible, if I were to describe everything I think about Zara, surely the text would be endless. First, all the products arrive at my house impeccably packaged, similar to a gift box. Inside all the boxes, there is a white tissue paper, wrapping the products, sealed with a gold or silver sticker. Absolutely impeccable and very beautiful. Then I need to talk about customer service, which is without a doubt one of the best I've ever asked for help.",5
2021,"The customer service suck's!!! Really need be care more, i spend a lot of money in this store, and in my last purchase they send part with UPS and the another with a random shipping company who never bring my box and never communicated. I just knew weeks after when finally I find someone attended me by phone(on zara) that they try to coming but because they don't find me they returned. So months after: no money, no clothes either.",1
2021,"At 1st I never knew how to navigate it but now I've graduated from a novice to a pro.the only issue I have is the size chart which is off as well as the image shown for some clothing products which are a bit misleading. Other from that,the app it great😊",5

2021,Great clothes,5
2021,"My all time fav. I prefer this brand only. . Highly recommended to others. This brand follows current fashion, awesome quality, great fittings, I am in love with this brand. No other brand ever take place of this. When I got introduced with this brand 5 years ago, I didn't get any other brand in this level. This website is good. Once I made mistake on my address, but customer service is really nice, they helped me like anything. Wanna write more, bt less space. ALWAYS BEST EXPERIENCE HERE.",5

2021,Good,5
2021,My favorite shopping app :),5
2021,Wonderful I enjoy using this App as it is easy and accessible.,5
2021,It sucks in android. Please make it smooth and great like in iOS,1
2021,Great,4
2021,"The app is visually pleasing and I especially like the fact that you can go from an item to the next with a simple swipe. It has all the order-related details at hand. On the negative side, the filter option could work better. If you select on option (ex: ""long sleeves"", certain price), it wil not include all the items that match the description. It should also include a price filter from cheapest to priciest and viceversa. I'd also like a black backgroud option. All in all, a good experience!",4
2021,App is great but customer service despicable. I returned 2 orders in one box to save them postal fees. Unfortunately they said one item was missing from box and wouldn't refund me. A staff member told me it was an internal issue being investigated. Either way I didn't benefit. So people do not oblige. Take photos and return separately,4
2021,Zara online worst app I have ever seen send my order another address still not refund customer service not available no one response cheated with customers. Can't chat on app .,1
2021,"As much as Zara is known for its premium in-store service, it's pathetic to say the least in its online services. A classic example of why it's not easy to go online if brands can't change their operational strategy. Been more than a month and still waiting for my refund of two orders.",1
2021,"The worst, I tried to reset my password and followed all the steps needed and I didn't receive any email in order to reset it. I contacted the chat from the app and someone there told me that they didn't find my detail contacts in the system, I sent a screenshot with my last order and my contact details and she told me that my account my have been blocked. And beside that I returned a product from last month through the app and nobody came to pick it up. The woooooorst!!!!",5
2021,Very friendly n satisfying,5

2021,The ultimate shopping experience.,5
2021,"I had ordered a product from Zara recently,but unfortunately the delivery address was mistaken as it was supposed to be delivered somewhere else.Since,it was my first time experience with Zara, I didn't knew that it'll be so awful experience I'll ever had. I have several times made an attempt to customer care services to sort out my problems regarding the refunding of my amount, but everytime they're making an excuses. It's almost been one and a half month,still my problems hasn't been sorted",1
2021,"Bought 4 items, received only 1. When i asked why, the customer service told me to wait for 3 days. After 3 days, they asked for another 3. And its almost a month but no answer. The customer service chat needs improvement. Cant open other app or the chat is disconnected.",5

2021,Worst ever.. Customer care is also the worst... Refund was never made till now nor reference number is given so how to complain to the bank without reference number.. Even the call number is unavailable now,1
2021,Worst customer sales agent ever. Rudeness as it's finest.,1
2021,Very great collection... addicted!,5
2021,Noch.,1
2021,The chat bar glitches and typing disables. Can't get help with a missing order because I can't write messages to the customer service rep.,1

2021,Nice but costly,5
2021,👍,4
2021,Always a problem with the ifsc code.,1
2021,"There are no proper filters, to filter out out of stock items.Most of the products are out of stock still visible in display.",1
2021,Nice awesome,5
2021,Cannot find Size guide for trouser. I should have read the review before registering zara - I agree with all that is being said about the site - RUBBISH,1
2021,"Zara's clothes, lovely. Zara's app, less than pathetic. Service is WELL below par. All I wanted to do was load a payment card and it's just a nightmare.. They can't find the reason and so it's a shame.. The WhatsApp customer service takes days and you still can't get the answers you need to progress.. Zara, please invest in your website and app.",1
2021,No variety to see. Limited stock,1
2021,"My account has been deleted apperantly for no reason so my purchase history is now lost. I have made a new account with the same email and now I cannot load the application as per my location and currency. Chat technical support is SHOCKING !!! Incompetent, slow, taking in incomplete sentences and have not resolved any of the issues I had but rather just kept repeating the error messages that they are getting from the system in their end which means NOTHING to me!!!!",1
2021,Very bad app cant select the country,1
2021,"I can not order, it says error no matter if I try it using web or app. And customer service didn't help me at all (((",1

2021,Cheap material brand,1
2021,Boom,5
2021,Live chat easily disconnects.,1
2021,Love it,5
2021,Worst app in the world. Idk why they have filters. They are useless and as results are shown products that are out of stock. It's nerve recking. Lots of patience is needed to use this total bs of an app.,1
2021,Everything is out of stock even the new collection..so what's the importance of the app !!,1
2021,So disappointed app which takes money from account and don't proceed the order.,1
2021,Bad customer service,1
2021,Love this app,5
2021,"Whoever was UX engineer on this has done a horrendous job. Apart from difficult to access categories, the product view, arguably most important thing,is garbage. You have to scroll up to see different images of a product, but since there's another event(product details) attached to swipe up action at the bottom, you bring up that instead of image change. And when you perform swipe up higher, because thumb moves in more of an arc, it changes the product(horizontal swipe action triggers) Worst UX.",1
2021,Worst app ever,1
2021,The worst and the baddest customer services Once you purchase you will never get your money back even its damage don't use Zara online,1
2021,Purchasing online from Zara is a completely different experience than purchasing from their shop. I bought online a jacket and after a month it started shatter at the sewing. I requested to change the item but they decided by only a picture that it is my fault. I am going to take the case to the South African small court and I will never ever purchase online. Im Zaras customer for almost 20 years (I bought almost every clothes from Zara from Hungary). I'm very disappointed at the moment.,1
2021,Accrurate size estimation for more than 95% of product. Easy to see. Good pic and ref,5
2021,"Can you do something about your customer care please, it is pathetic",1
2021,"There's some nifty features in the app and visually it's nice to browse, but it's missing some basics like remembering items I have put in my cart the next time I come back to the app.",3
2021,Easy and user-friendly,5
2021,Worst shopping app ever. They keep postponing the date of delivering my purchase. I regret ever spending my money on this online store. Now I am just trying to get my refund back. There is no contact number that you can call. What kind of a store is that?! I wouldn't advice anyone to use this app.,1
2021,Wow good,1
2021,"Great for the most part. Not sure if this falls to the developer but it would be great to have ""Sold Out"" items not show up in the filtered selections, why do I need to be tortured by items no longer available.",4
2021,Ok,5
2021,"Most of the ui elements work half of the time. Can't create an account and every couple of months the app decides that i cannot log in.. Update: now not only I cannot log in, now even creating a new account is impossible.",1
2021,"Items were cancelled without sending any notice via email or whatsover. We tried contacting the help centre but not much help at all!! No reason explained, just told us to wait for the refund for 14 bloody days and keep checking it with our bank!! Wow so much help.. should change the name to USELESS centre perhaps!!!",1
2021,Pls don't use this app for shopping..continuessely rejected my order and courier partner behaviour is very bad ... totally waste of time ...,1
2021,"I'll suggest that you opt for store purchase instead of ordering items online. Zara's customer support in one of the worst service I have ever encountered. But this inevitable as they have a customer support without a feedback system. They'll will make you feel like they are doing some favours by talking to you. You will never get a follow up from them, they are just rude and don't care at all. If your refund is stuck then forget it, you are never getting your money back.",1
2021,Cant cancel an order because of a technical issue and contacted customer services to cancel and took to twitter as well. No response,2
2021,Pathetic service by zara.sent me clothes having blood on it and on box too.2 different size tags on the same trouser & no tag on 1 trouser.how the zara is premium? Can't see anything to upload photos or video of the clothes.shame zara.,1
2021,Everything is fine. It just won't take account details which means you won't be able to return.,1
2021,Website is hard to navigate.,1
2021,Items just dissapear from the cart. If i put items on cart..have to buy immediately otherwise if buying later they wont be in cart.,2
2021,There is no indication that an item is out of stock beforehand.,1
2021,Really easy to use.,5
2021,Thoda price jyada otherwise it's fab,5
2021,"NOOOO compren nada por la app!!!!!. Cuando tienen que devolver la ropa van a la tienda y la plata despues la app te lo devuelve... Ya paso más de 1 mes y aun no recibí nada. Llamas a la tienda no se hacen responsables te mandan hablar con el chat de la app. Ya voy hablando 4 veces con el chat ""Marta"" y el robot siempre me dice lo mismo que me van a contactar.. así estoy más de un mes esperando. NO TE DEVUELVEN LA PLATA Y NADIE TE CONTACTA. MUY MAL SERVICIO! Desilusión total con zara!!!",1
2021,Good one n amazing fabric 🙂,5
2021,I can make an account. The app is not allowing me to fill my information,1
2021,Although the item is out of stock but still shown,2
2021,The refund process is very hectic and most importantly THE CUSTO.ER CARE SERVICE IS EXXXTREMELY POOR oly for this reason i dont wish place order again from this site,1
2021,Aaaand here we go again. Can't log in in the app,1
2021,Wrost experience in zara app I returned the product but I haven't received my refund max30 days is over,1
2021,NO REFUND! I've been contacting the customer service about a refund and they're just dodging it by saying that I'll get an email. But no further process has been done. When I asked to talk to the manager the agent KICKED ME OUT OF THE CHAT! PATHETIC! I wonder how Zara is saving money by not advertising and not giving refunds.,1
2021,The worst application and experience with zara India. There is no update on the delivery and neither any response from the customer care. The delivery status automatically updated to customer not available/ address closed. Did not even get any call before delivery nothing.,1
2021,"Worst low grade cheap quality products.. I bought a shirt which got torn on the first day I wore it. Customer care is pathetic... I asked me to share images of the product and tags... At last they mentioned as it got torn due to use... How come a fabric gets torn on the first day of use? It can be only due to cheap quality of the product. Never going to buy again from Zara. Local vendors are far better. Disgusting, n felt cheated.",1
2021,Don't bother wasting your money and time buying online with this app. Your orders will get cancelled and you have to constantly follow up for your refund on an app which fails to load. Its really not worth the stress.,1
2021,Op,4
2021,🥰,5
2021,Such a worst shopping app ever used . 🤦🤦🤦🤦,1

2021,Great app,5
2021,Fan zara,5
2021,Worse experience 😪,1
2021,Don't expect your items to be delivered on the specified time and date.,2
2021,The help section doesn't work. Unable to reach out to customer care in case of delayed delivery and now the option to return the item is disabled. The customer service has detriortated by leaps and bounds,1
2021,All things out of stock and that's not even shown Once you open it then only you can check,1
2021,Status of item is only showing delivered even after amount get refunded.,2
2021,"Customer service is very bad and Refund Money issue..return policy process so bad, and refund Money not received within 14days.. but zara product is good, quality also good, but customer service and refund policy is very bad. And delivery charges very high",1
2021,"It was my first Zara online experience and it was really bad because I had ordered for a Zara Puffer jacket but to my surprise the right hand sleeve of the jacket was damaged. After reviewing this app review, i did not want to return the product as we all know that we would not get our refunds. So had to keep this jacket .",1
2021,not useful for india,1
2021,"Saat berbelanja tidak diberitahu kalau barang dikirim dari luar negeri, padahal saya ada kebutuhan memakai barangnya urgent.

2021,"Nice clothes and good sale prices, but the problem is Charge of delivery. It cost 290RS to get something delivered at home which is a lot . If you don't like the product 290RS waste if you return the product. Do something about delivery charge system.",3
2021,It doesnt work at all . They dont respond on chat,1
2021,Very uncomfortable to use,1
2021,Your customer care sucks. I tried to contact your customer care via chat and they take so much time to respond to your query and then automatically shuts down the chat saying you have been inactive for a while. There is no provision to call. I am trying to track my refunds from past few day for around 5k and its not responding,1
2021,Great app..very simple and easy to use,4

2021,Pathetic customer support. They do not have a customer care number. Their representatives in chat section do not reply. They do not have a support email listed anywhere as well. Haven't got refund for an order cancelled on 17 July 2021 and there is no one to connect with. Extremely poor.,1
2021,My fav zara,5

2021,All the products aren't available so why are u making it on,1

2021,"Very Hard to use ,very difficult procedure to Refund",1
2021,Worst service ever i would say... neither there vhat support works nor the contact no . They have provided.,1
2021,Pathetic customer service. They don't give proper response and I am pretty sure they are bots. They only give limited answer and make you wait eternity for reply. My 5k is stuck and there is no way of contacting them. Its already been 3 weeks and i have contaced them several times. I have no choice but to sought some legal actions. So much for being famous international brand. They cheat customer of their money and have no deceny to soleve the issue. Just please safe yourself of the trouble.,1
2021,Excellent,5
2021,"i couldn't create an account, so the wishlist and the cart didn't work.",1

2021,Pathetic,1
2021,"Worst online experience Not getting things on time, at the last day of estimated date of delivery, they are not sure they shipped to courier or not.",1
2021,No good!,1
2021,Too much charges for Delivery charges.Else other apps don't charge too much like zara or give free shipping.,2
2021,The app doesnt have options like sort by price low to high. They take forever (14 days plus) to deliver the order and they are also unable to deliver in the timeframe provided by them.,2
2021,"SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! You'll never receive the product you pay for, and will lose your money. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1
2021,Chat not existent..!,3
2021,Worst app ever. Always crashing. Can't do anything on it,1
2021,"Read this Review BEFORE INSTALLING this app. If you are purchasing, assume that you lost that amount. They say they have refund/replacement policy, but do not do a pickup and hence they won't refund/replace. Their measurements tend to be different from the other brands and hence its obvious that you would receive a mis-fit clothing. And their customer support is pathetic. Not available on mobile, NO email response and on chat you just have to wait for eternity. Very pathetic experience, didn't expect this from Zara given the cost of the products is very high.",1
2021,Best in class... Love the products... For those who are looking for unique & stylish... Go for it..,5
2021,Worst customer service Among the four items I bought..one of the item was missing..complained many times..in zara chat..no good response..from them...thank you,1
2021,Don't trust this aap cos when u return there product they won't refund money n there is no customer care number or mail id of this aap.,1

2021,Worst customer service,1
2021,Very bad support,1
2021,Such a disappointment. I din't knw sites like these are doing such kind of fraud. I returned a product and its about a month and my refund is still not recieved. No call facility no reply to my mails nil response at all. Please dn't but anythng from ZARA because whem you return it they are not going to give you your money back.,1
2021,"Horrible customer care service no contact number provided, no email, virtual assistant chat service and no refunds!!!!",1
2021,I have ordered and it's showing its delivered in app ...very bad customer services..not satisfied,1
2021,It's the worst,1
2021,"Worst app with worst customer care with worst service they didn't even reply you . Pathetic experience never shop online this is a scam they don't refund money, not expected such from this big company.",1
2021,Worst Customer Service,1
2021,ordered A set of perfume 100-100 ml each from Zara which is worth 1290 and recieved a 30ml man perfume instead. The customer care is telling me they escalated my return request but it's been 2 months and I've not received a single call or any email. They told me to attach an image but it was not possible because there were no attachment links. Totally disappointing. My 990inr are wasted on zara. And there's no way I can return this now. What to do ? I want my refund ASAP.,1
2021,"Didnt, checked yet",5
2021,Has to be the best shopping app thus far,5
2021,"I tried after I tried after I tried to try the right to write to him, try to look for him after a week and two days have passed.",1
2021,Poor service with poor app features and product,1

2021,Worst app.. i made return request .. and they don't repond at call.. contact facility is not available.,1
2021,El app no funciona las images tardan mucho en bajar en ocaciones nunca Bajan.,2
2021,"The app only allows you to register an account for United States. But on the website I can change the country...then you cannot register on the website either because everything you type will give 'incorrect parameters' when submitted, which is the most useless error ever.",1
2021,"Horrible service, item went missing and Zara customer service did little to help and basically equated that its my problem to resolve the matter. I had to constantly chase them and the staff were very rude and unhelpful the whole time even when they were in the wrong for failing to deliver.",1
2021,Favourite,5
2021,The worst online shopping experience ever. I orderd a pair of shoes and I waited for almost 16 days and I didn't receive anything and every time I contact the customer service they just say it's being prepared ...and when you cancel the order you need to wait for 14 working days to get your money back. Honestly I don't recommend anyone to use this app or to buy online from ZARA.,1
2021,"Zara is disappointing me so many times. I have orders showing DELIVERED when I never received, I have cancelled order without my concern while I was waiting for the order. I also have order which is partially delivered, yet I never received or get a feedback. Assistance in chat is very very poor. ONLINE SERVICES ARE VERY VERY POOR. OUT OF 6 ORDERS I ONLY RECEIVED 1 WHILE OTHERES WHERE CANCELED AND SHOWING PARTIALLY DELIVERED WHILE SOME STILL SHOWING IN PREPARATION.",1
2021,Mujahideens App...,1
2021,Worst app. Doesn't address to customer grievances at all. Never buy from zara online. No refund on returns and customer service is worst in all of online shopping . Not customer friendly . Never going to buy again from Zara .,1
2021,I ordered online and paid for it After recieveing the goods it did not fit and we have been requesting for return and refund for the last two months. After regular follow up the call centre representative asked us to go to store and return it. I drove 1 he to the store and here they say They have nothing to do with the online business. We have to talk to the online team Zara online is a scam Be ready to loose money if you buy Zara online,1
2021,Not customer service oriented. Zara needs to improve 😣😐,1
2021,"Ordering is great, online support SUCKS!!!! Didnt receive an item in my delivery, NO HELP WHATSOVER, CHALK IT UP AS A LOSS, NOT WORTH THE STRESS",3
2021,When I try to log into my account it keeps kicking me out and saying that it doesn't exist even thought it does.This is ridiculous.I hope this gets fixed and also the Chat Service didn't help aswell.It is very hard to do a return because it requested more than once for me when I tried to return an item I didn't prefer.I recommend going into the shops instead of online,1
2021,"Being a global brand, invest some money in developing your application. It cannot even register a new user.",1
2021,"You can't erase adresses after you create them, ""help"" option is a joke... Chat disables after 1 min of inactivity and it takes someone >10 mins to respond, had order come up with wrong adress and no way to cancel or modify, honestly a terrible app in general and even worse customer service.",1
2021,I cant cancel any order,3
2021,I love shopping from Zara,5
2021,Poor customer service. Not able to file for return. And customer care too is not available.,1
2021,"The help centre (which is through chat on the web or app) is beyond teribble. I had ordered 3 products, but one of them got cancelled because they didn't have the product and they informed me that the 2 other products are being send. But few weeks later, again, they informed me that both of the products were also empty. And now because i wanted to get my money from the 3 products that i've been paid, i contacted zara chat for help, and the chat always glitch. Please help !!",1
2021,"Good products with worst service, Zara is a big name, do justice with service too.",1
2021,Worst customer support,1
2021,Great App... But when u want to make a refund...The bank details section is messed up... Just fix that issue,2
2021,Absolutely dreadful. Trying to purchase item online with Zara gift card and have to download Zara app each time. Very frustrating,1
2021,It didn't worked,1
2021,Cannot track the package and the worse live chat,1
2021,Love zara. Hate this app. And when i try to use their website the app opens without event though i dont want it.,2
2021,Not easy returns,2
2021,Terrible customer services. The chat window closes down on its own even if it has been left idle for 2 mintues. The customer service agents just don't respond in time leading to a closed chat window with absolutely no outcome. I raised complaints twice regarding an order but nothing happened. No body came back to me. The agents just mentioned we will get back to you in a moment and they are gone. I can't even track my complaints. If you are not willing to listen to us then just don't pretend.,1
2021,One of the worst applications I've ever seen and half of the time it doesn't work and freezes up,1
2021,Best online shopping app👌,5

2021,Not able to add sizes in the cart . Shows no size but when I looked up on the website and not the app the items were available . So the app is kind of useless .,1
2021,Amazing,4
2021,Please make side scrolling for item other pics.. its not easy on hand for uoward movement,4
2021,"Nowadays they have problems with shipping, I still not getting my stuffs but it shows delivered, so disappointing. It is going 2nd times",1
2021,"Ordered something they tried to deliver it to my house twice, unfortunately I wasn't home. I asked for my package twice on separate days where they told me they'd ask the delivery company to send to my house, nothing happened and now I'm not getting my stuff cause it's ""out of stock"". Ridiculous. At least I'm getting a refund, which might only get here in 14 days. Unninstal this devil app",1
2021,Nice very nice,5
2021,Horrible app with a horrible payment gateway. Charged me money which was debited from my account and then said my payment hasn't processed. They don't even have any customer care service that is easily available. Horrible experience,1
2021,"Can't return the product through APP, always let me type the correct address, it is the correct address, it's been several months, and they still don't fix it.",1
2021,Why does it keep locking me out of the customer care chat? Based on inactivity? I wait for the agent to reply and meanwhile it ends the chat because apparently i was inactive. i had to contact 4 different people to explain them the same problem and still got locked out. Why? Plus i had to make 2 payments and still my order was not confirmed. really bad experience with Zara app,1
2021,Gonna have to say no to Zara. Really liked them and still would. But they can't redeliver and they refund less than what was paid from what I saw. Not happy and won't be recommending or shopping here anymore. Shame really. They beeb around for a long yet they can't re deliver. They leave driver number who doesn't pick up either. Plus they drive all day so how can they pick up..? Looks disorganised,1
2021,"Highly disappointed, haven't received the paid online order even after 20 days n there is no proper customer care services to reply on this,only 1 customer care number for entire India,pathetic. It's really unacceptable from a brand like Zara!!",2
2021,Ugly app and the chat customer service is poor. Nobody responds properly and it sounds like pre-generated messages being sent everytime I talk to an agent. Horrible experience.,1
2021,♥️♥️♥️♥️,5

2021,I don't even want to give one star it is the worst app i have ever used . Really poor customer services even the staff is rude it's been 3 weeks haven't got my order nor i can't cancel it cause there's is no option to do the shittiest app and store ever please do not order from here .,1

2021,So happy to use it,5
2021,Nice,5
2021,"Love the app but performance not stable. Love the ability to scan barcodes of items in the store, save, and search for availability online. However, the UX on scanning receipts for purchases etc is not easy to find nor intuitive. Once scanned, they are not always appearing in the ""in-store"" list under Purchases in the user profile. Looks like a bug here in persistence of the data and image. Another note is that items out of stock online, should have that status reflected throughout the app.",3
2021,Unable to login and customer support doesn't even bother to solve the problem at all,1
2021,They claim to accept returns but their app refuses to do so. Their is no contact number for help. We can only CHAT with them. And I waited for half an hour but go no response in the chat window. This app sucks,1

2021,"Since the day after I ordered the stuff it's saying the items are being prepared.... When asked for help in chat, they repeated the same thing.

Fast delivery, in 3days max we receive our parcels- ordered on 29 June 2021 today is 7 July and still no delivery. They don't call to check availability to make sure you are there to receive parcel. Superbalist collects at the delivery address-no need to print and take the parcel to postnet for a return and there is an option to refund money to the app wallet not just back to the card.",1

I didn't figure it out until two days later when i checked on the status. Contacted zara, they said ""it was sent to the address it was sent to."" Then ceased conversation! Like literally no goodbye, just ""hung up"" lol! I have the screenshot. Thankfully, I went to the address and they returned my items. This app sucks, don't use it. Zara sucks for too.",1
2021,I had good experience at the beginning when I installed the app but later it started hanging and taking endless time to download images. At the end it wasn't recognising my email so I couldn't log in nor place any purchase order,2

2021,Can't use the text boxes to register!?!,1
2021,I much prefer shopping on the website. 2 main reasons: 1. I was unable to finalise at checkout. 2. Items appeared out of stock in the app while I was still able to purchase them on the website,1
2021,Terrible app. I tried to reset my password but did not receive the promised email. I tried to add an in-stock item to the basket and was told it was out of stock. Each time I open the app it says connection has failed even though I am on (functioning) mobile data.,1
2021,I guess they have 2 items in stock. 10 out 10 times they started the biggest sales unprepared.,1
2021,"Terrible. It doesn't work without giving it access to your location, hungs while registering and it lets you add items that are immediately after shown as out of stock in the checkout.",1
2021,I and many other people do online shopping from website. I understand the strategy behind pushing the people to download app. However this is very stupid and unnecessary step because everyone will delete it again when the sale is over! Website is closed to shopping and we're not able to log in app and there is no customer service after that. I already found an alternative brand Jack& Jones! Better quality reasonable price. Marketing team should resign or kicked out after this foolishness.,1

2021,"Pathetic Indian customer care service. My order was not delivered by the delivery agent - Delhivery. The customer care first asked me to contact the agent to know the details. If you cannot track the package, what the use of customer care service? The package was not delivered to me, rather returned by the delivery agent with the reason that I rejected the parcel. I did not even get a single call for delivery. I paid extra delivery charges for this kind of behaviour?",1
2021,Very bad app,1
2021,Exactly what I ordered nd delivery was fast thanx,5
2021,Scammer !!!! They processed 2 payements from 1 order on my card.,1
2021,Cant change country,5

2021,Perfect,5
2021,"I ordered a pair of heels that were delivered to me on the 26th of May, 2021. The heels were really amazing BUT the size was a little larger and I needed a smaller size. I placed the return but the app got my adress wrong. Two days later, they fixed it by filing another return and cancelling the previous one. It's been more than 4 days and no one has come to get my return order. Everytime I call the customer service, they ask me to wait for 48 hours. I give it 2 more days and then consumer court",1
2021,"When you item into the cart it doesn't allow you to save them or fav them, you can't even save them in come back to it, it disappeared and you would have to start all over again 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️",1

I've spent the last 10 minutes speaking to 4 different people as the moment I try to attach a picture to show the wrong item that was sent, it says I have been disconnected due to inactivity. Pls provide an email address for us to contact you!",1
2021,"The models all look amazing and beautiful and thank you for the representation in race. Is there a specific reason they're all skinny though, is your target market that specific body type? Because it would be great if you could also have representation in body shapes as well especially since we can't simply walk into stores and fit the clothing anymore due to covid. It would make the online shopping experience easier. So please consider it.",1
2021,Good product,5
2021,Always hanging and very slow to respond,1

2021,Getting worse with every update,2
2021,"Terrible, cannot pay for my order.....",1
2021,Why are the models moody angry ambivalent n in your face n oversexualized? It's like no.one allowed to be down to earth n innocent anymore. It really puts me off the clothes n is distracting. I dont want to be anything like them. If it was just the clothing. I'd give you 5 stars. Really wide interesting selection. But I wont buy anything cause I feel I'd be in coersion representing women like that. Vomitous.,1
2021,This is the worst app to navigate. It won't let me see all my purchases. The way the models are modeling you can see the for of the clothes. I love Zara. Just not the app,1
2021,App becoming slow,1
2021,طريقة عرض المنتجات والصور سيئة ..لاتظهر موديل القطعه وخاصة عري العارضات مزعج وغير جميل ولا يظهر جمال القطعه ولا اتخيلها كيف ستبدو بوضعية عادية كلها وضعيات فنية وغير جميلة,1

2021,Worst app I can't even access my older account,1
2021,Pretty fashionable clothes are here and it's quite cheap,5
2021,This app is good but the issue comes when you have some problem with the order is far more complicated to resolve compared to the store. In the store have more options and have more sense and are more concerned about your problem.,1

2021,They haven't refunded my money as yet. It's veen more that 12 days. And there customer service team sucks big time. They just don't give a damn.

2021,Good,4
2021,I have a lot of problem..its not easy to reach customer care and the refund option is very difficult,2
2021,"I have orders indicate that they have shipped, weeks go by and the order never makes it to delivery point. Contacted customer service and waa told the order was shipped back to Zara due to shipping issues. No updates on the app or even an email letting me know the order was on way back to Zara. Second time this has occurred with Zara with no update on order. Never had this shipping issue or lack of update with other companies.",1
2021,WoW very easy,5
2021,Fashionable,5
2021,"Laggy, either never opens-never ending loading screen- or stops loading mid browsing, a frustrating experience, not a user friendly app.",1
2021,"Possibly the WORST shopping app I've ever encountered! No menu, indecipherable collections and never did find the search function. All I wanted was to buy some tops. Total waste of time. Show us your clothes not your budget blowing fashion shoot shots.",1

2021,Well balanced and clean interface. Premiumness in every aspect the quality of every single product is up to the mark and it's interface is not like other cheap Indian shopping website. Must go. No ads too.,5
2021,Worst return policy! Had items sent to me by my sister as a gift and I couldn't return or exchange for anything in store because I didn't have a gift receipt. Items were current and less than 30 days from date of purchase. Items are useless now because they are too small for my baby. Very disappointed!,1

2021,"Can't say much about the app, my question is why is SA ZARA stops at XL for majority of their items...and not XXL yhuuu ha.a",1

2021,"Was a very good app until the latest update and now I'm unable to open any of my saved favourites. I can see them but can't access them individually so to order them I will now have to search for them again in main menu. I only have about 10 items saved so it's not that i5 have too many. Cleared cache, data and uninstalled and installed again but still not able to access",1
2021,What is the point of having a favorites option if you can't actually click on the items in your favorites to order? They are just there to look at...how dumb,1

2021,I like the collection of this zara app,5
2021,I am unable to track my order and later I hv come to know that my order was cancelled without any notification. I was told to place the order again and then again I could track it after a few days I contacted them just to know that it has been cancelled again. I don't know what the hell is happening with them. The chat gets over again and again and everytime there is new person so I had to tell them the same thing again and again. Very poor customer dealing. Horrible experience!,1
2021,Worst app ever.blodddy,1
2021,Awesome app.,5
2021,"Absolutely pathetic. It defaults to United States and if I click on the arror to change it, it moves forward with other settings without changing the region",1

2021,the app is poorly made and makes it very frustrating however I discovered about 98% of the merchandise is ugly and most of it over priced.,1
2021,Ketika barang datang. Store ga scan barcode biar pembeli tau barang dah sampe. Setelah sebulan lebih disamperin. Baru discan. Lalu masuk notif barang ready diambil. Parah sih sampe barcode nya pudar. Kalau ga disamperin ke store. Pembeli ga akan tau kalau barang dah sampe sebulan lalu,1
2021,Am unable to make payments for the past 2 weeks now the website is terrible,1

2021,It's not user-friendly.,2
2021,"I loved that app but the latest relase simply doesn't work properly. Sometimes my saved payment method working, Sometimes it is not working, no feedback.

2021,Not friendly at all,1
2021,I set up an email notification for a bag that I wanted but was out of stock. Immediately after receiving the notification that the bag was available I went to the app with the intention of purchasing it only to find that it was out of stock AGAIN. It was probably sold out during the day since I received the notification late afternoon. You continuously FAIL to let me know on time about item's availability so I don't understand WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT OF THIS OPTION??????????,1
2021,Very good app,5
2021,Love it,5
2021,Nice ui design 👌,5
2021,Worst website. The clothes are so dull and unimpressive including the models which make it more dull. The price is too much for such boring clothes. Didn't liked it at all!!,1
2021,Never ever had I had a problem when making a purchase online and delivery turn around is always on time. Any returns I had made had great assistance. User friendly app.,5
2021,"It has to be updated with what actually in stock, it makes me searching and all items are out of stock and all sizes are not available 😔😔",2
2021,"This app just deletes your saved items when they are out of stock, dosent notify you, dosent tell you when they are low on stock and you can even find them anymore in the list, which they never get restocked. This app is ridiculous...",1
2021,"Really bad shopping experience , i have ordered some clothes and they were not my size so i returned them on like 11- April, but there is no refund till now ,like its 26-april today and there is no refund and there customer service is the worst and they are like testing my patience.",1
2021,Too complicated,1
2021,The worst shopping app ever.,1

2021,"The app is a great way to save my favourite items, shop and browse the zara site, safely and easily online. I gave three stars because the app sometimes feel like a basic wish list of items for me. I would love for the opportunity to be alerted, when my favoured item(s) is low in stock (including the amount left). It would be awesome if sales, new items in store etc. from the app is also linked back to my email or text messages sent to phone (provided as an option to consumers).",3
2021,Why don't you guys improve your app Worst refund and customer service . I mean like I have been struggling to get the refund for more than 3 weeks still got delivered in the wrong account. I am trying to call them for more than 3 days either their lines are busy or their is no one to chat as well. Worst app . Pathetic. Can't believe this app has been given 4 stars doesn't even deserves 1 star.,1
2021,The Fashion And Style Is Perfect.,5
2021,Nice valuable product,5
2021,👍,4
2021,"In wanting to minimalize and give it a more streamlined look, they have removed a lot of useful information. For example, I wanted to check which payment method I used on a recent purchase, and it's just nowhere. Not listed ANYWHERE. Not when I download the e-ticket, not when I check my purchase history, nowhere. Half the error messages you get (""offline, try again"") turn out to be BS. Zara online customer service is also terrible, and you can't reach anyone by phone.",2
2021,"This is an example of a bad evolution...they want to be so different, that they just forget the basic function of this app: show and sell the products !",1

2021,"I like Zara, but HATE the app and the way they display the items. You just don't know what's for sale and what's just a random photo. It's complicated to just look at the products you want to see. Often items are shown in black & white, and while I'm sure this is intended to be 'styleised', it's just frustrating. Display the items simply, so it's easy to scroll through and see what you want to buy! I've stopped buying from Zara on the app and online because it's just a frustrating experience.",1
2021,Zara stole my money... they made 2 transactions but I only bought 1 item... then they're delivery is over 2 weeks late. Not impressed at all.,1

This is the 4th day the delivery is late. I am cancelling the cc payment tomorrow and not accepting delivery. This customer service is atrocious,1
2021,"Since it is not available for huawai, it was working yesterday 🤨",1
2021,"App is a nightmare. I love Zara and used to buy clothes from website a lot. App is terrible, you can't see full selection of products and very difficult to navigate.",1

2021,"Shopping with zara was good, i like 👍",5
2021,Items from my favorite gets randomly deleted all of the sudden every other day. It's very annoying. It needs to be fixed.,3
2021,Annoying because it let's me put items in the basket but they're not really there on the site and can't check them out!,3
2021,"Zara is running a big time scam by not refunding the money even after 2 months of product return. Their customer service is pathetic, the representatives don't have any manners, their chats are not saved, there is no help from anyone from Zara.",1
2021,Ok,3
2021,Very slow in uploading data but top stars for all the rest,4
2021,Material was not good. Very expensive 👎,1
2021,Veyy hard to use,1
2021,3 times I've tried to purchase and on 3 different days & all I get is a message saying something went wrong please tried later,1
2021,Brilliant,5
2021,absolutley sh!te. how are you supposed to navigate around to shop for clothes?? all i find is childrens faces smiling? i bet theres loads of clothes that can be sold BUT WE JUST CANT SEE THEM!! sales would boost if you sorted this app so its straight forward enough to actually see the clothes. and tell your models to stand up straight its off putting.,1
2021,Not for mans,1
2021,There is no Indian option,1
2021,Customer service is very very bad. They never have any answer to ur queries. They delay reponses.,2
2021,I'm not even able to register myself and start the app,1
2021,I adore Zara since moving I need app I rather wait n drive I'm a personal Stylist.Worst app I'm in design and fashion business. I tried so many times you never know if you put in basket most times have to go back and changethe amount of pieces. It also hard to change size when shopping for clients. I used other means. What really Sucks I get to end cash out half not in . Stuff in sale in All Sizes out of stock but shows to buy Do a American one and UK if we shop different I don't know demograph,1
2021,its difficult to use .. minimal equalls to none information,1
2021,Awesome,5
2021,This is very nice app,5
2021,Very good brand and its sizes are fited well.... Thank you ZARA.,5
2021,I m so sorry to say that this app is one of the worst. I hope ZARA could do something...it makes shopping online so VERY frustrating.,1
2021,"Nehh Sorry Try harder as the app is not helping, not easy to find and buy",1
2021,"The app is so safe to order and just excellent.The best thing is that you can pay at your house when the order come.And second best thing that you have somethink like a way of order,and you can see in every time where your order is.So safety",5
2021,idk why just the service,3
2021,Worst app. . Order is delivered so late you'll get old. Please don't waste your time and money here.,1
2021,Incredibly difficult to navigate. Just go to the store.,1
2021,App crashing all the time!,1
2021,"The chat is awful. I wanted to return one of the clothes bought through this app because it wasn't like on the picture, but as their store is closed in my area, they said only home return is possible through their app or website. I already did 3 times and everytime it shows a courier incident. So whatever you buy from Zara online, be careful it won't be possible to return later",1
2021,"Payment options are not intuitive. If you have to back out of a payment option the shopping bag (cart) deletes all of the merchandise. Once the payment method is completed, acknowledgment of payment is not forthcoming, leaving the customer unsure of the transaction.",1
2021,It's working good,3
2021,"Why can't they deliver to Guwahati, India. Please start the service. Every other brand has been delivering to Guwahati.",3
2021,Not user friendly,1
2021,"the sign in and register feature doesnt work. i tried to register an account through the app and it didnt work, had to go on the webiste and register. After registering through website, i tried to log in through the app but it wouldnt sign in. Please add the night mode for android",2

2021,"Used to be really good but as of late the app won't open and I just get a buffer wheel until I force quit the application, highly annoying",3

2021,Good,3
2021,"Sizing tool not acurate, terrible wrong. They tell me i am size M. My hip area is 44 inches. ???",1
2021,Good,5
2021,"Always a great experience. Receive my orders way before the estimated date. My problem is with the sizing, maybe its with the fabrics used in certain items as I'm a XS-S on one item with a similar fibre construction and a M on another. Otherwise Zara is one of my go to shops.",5

2021,so easy to use but how hard is it to return items?,3
2021,Super basic app,1
2021,"Absolutely horrible. I made a prepaid order that never got delivered to me. They delivered it somewhere else (within two days for placing the order) and on complaining they sent me an invoice with a signature that was not even mine. I placed another order, a COD this time and it's been a week and they had not even shipped it. It's pathetic and the management is so incompetent. I neither received a refund for my previous order nor my package.",1
2021,Zara on shopee please!,5
2021,Mala. No permite seleccionar talles. Solamente pude una vez luego de actualizarla. Luego el error se repitió a pesar de volver a actualizarla. Desastrosa,1
2021,Earlier when I used to open this app I used to spend more time browsing through all the designs and see the new collection ...selection process was way more easier and it was quite user friendly.... I am not sure anymore...it looks way more confusing now with so many category options and too many layout changes and the actual shopping ease and experience is lost ...the old basic and simple minimalist zara was way more cooler.😔,3
2021,"The app constantly crashes, i can't log in, add anything to my basket or see my prev purchase details. Its so frutrating. I've uninstalled & installed as advised by cs several times..made no difference!!",1
2021,not easy to find specific items,1

2021,Fatastic,4
2021,"Would not allow me to add a photo to my chat with customer service, freezing and kicking me out, of the chat.

2021,Not happy with customer care services,1
2021,Nice app,5
2021,Too hard to see details on the garment when all images are fashion shoot images. Also swiping to get to different images when accidentally swiping the other way opens up a new style,1
2021,Thank you,5
2021,Nice,5
2021,"Very useful. However, there is a small drawback with chat: in case you are not active for 1 minute in a chat it is automatically switched off",5
2021,"Would be great , if zara would write models high and size , she wearing . And allowed feedback about items , as h&M do",4
2021,Best brand app,5

2021,App is dogwater,1
2021,"Incredibly hard to use, I like zara products but couldn't bear the pain to use this app. Developers, have you tried using it yourselves?All models look deeply miserable! Poor thing",1
2021,"Pas du tout ergonomique, on comprend rien au site Pas du tout agréable de passer commande, j'abandonne toujours",1
2021,Zara online always sent me below quality leather shoe and linen. Huge diffrence in quality of product comparative to their outlets. Suggestion: buy from zara outlet.,1
2021,Nice,5
2021,"I would advise anyone using this app to enter with a compass, a sextant, and a sherpa to find a single article of clothing. The app is pretty, sleek, and modern but feels like you're treking through mud mentally.",1
2021,The app is horrible as fas as contacting the executive is concerned. The chat just closeson it's own while we await reply from them. And then we have to restart all over again. Plus the contact phone number is out of order for the last 6 months at least. Poor professionalism,4
2021,Very bad service,1
2021,The products are so costly,1
2021,Very nice collection. My fav place to shop,5
2021,❤️,5
2021,"I can't stand this app. It makes it impossible to shop. I still can't find measurements for sizing anywhere and there are quite a few things I would like to order but since I don't know if they would remotely fit, I'm not buying anything. Just make a normal effing app to shop on",1

2021,"I ordered my shoes on 11/24/20 I was told that I would receive them by 11/30-12/1 but Zara still hasn't shipped them? When I contacted Zara they tried to blame the delay on the shipper when I can clearly see that they, Zara, has not shipped the product. If you order something from Zara please make sure to follow up on your order. This is very frustrating. Update: After my first order was corrected and received I haven't had any more issues. Thank you Zara.",5

One day later I have got an email that, order was chaged because of shortage of 4 of them and till now I have not get my money back.

2021,For the most bizarre reason the payment service stopped working. Though it reads my cards the owner field remains empty and a note in Hebrew language pops up (I'm a Greek user) Try to fill the fields manually same. I can only finalize my order logging in from web site 😕😕😕,2
2021,Not sure what any of the other reviews are talking about I have had good experience with all the things they are talking about. the only problem I'm having for the first time is trying to purchase and it says something went wrong try again later.

2021,Horrible service from Zara. Duped me of 10000rs. Made 3 purchases in November and they still haven't refunded the money. Didn't knew Zara was a fraud company which stole money like this.,1

2021,"Awful app. Super uncomfortable and complicated to use. It is not appealing to an eye and as an ordinary customer, I can't relate to the idea Zara is trying to sell. I am not skinny and not high street fashionista and I can't imagine myself wearing those clothes when it's made to look like it is out of my reach. I am a regural Zaras customer and I love their sophisticated clothes but when I come to shop here it feels as I entered fashion blog, not online shop! Make it relatable!",1

2021,Does not let you hold items in basket. Everytime i go to pay more then 80% basket is out of stock. I take no longer then 20 mins to browse each time over 5 times i had to empty basket and refill. So end of the day it is impossible to shop on this app with this issue.,1
2021,Payment method and transaction always fails,1
2021,The best,5
2021,Good 👍,5
2021,"An excellent, well designed app",5

2021,Horrible to see something.,1
2021,This app is horrible. I don't understand how one can be shopping and by the time you blink the sizes in your cart are gone. It give no time allowance for you to put several items in and make a purchase. By the time you attempt to check out you are advised the items are not available! Do better...seriously!!😡,1
2021,When there's a sale its not possible to purchase something. And the page it almost all the time BLOCKED.,3
2021,Not user friendly.,1

2021,I've been waiting for the items to restock for over a month.,1
2021,There's nothing in this app for guys . Zara app in other country have more clothes. Other than that product image quality is accurate.,1
2021,"Never buy online from Zara. Pathetic customer service. 🙄 worst experience. They don't offer a valid resolution if item is defective. They would only take return, no replacements which means if u wanna buy the same product either pay 300 shipping or buy items worth 3k. Never expected this from Zara. Used to like this brand but its not worth it.",1
2021,Nice app,5
2021,Excellent,4
2021,Twice they have removed items from my orders and easily just told me it was out of stock. It's a shame that such a big brand couldn't manage its site to make items unavailable before buying!!! And the most worst thing is that for refund not full amount would ne returned (item amount +delivery charge should be refund together in this situation that youuuuuu jad removed the item),1
2021,Over charging people in the UK,1
2021,Very good clothes number 1 quality of clothes,5
2021,It's pretty bad if I don't even remember this.,1

2021,Excellent,4
2021,"Refund process is long, tiring and will cost you lot of time and inconvenience. Never expected brand like Zara to have such bad return and refund system. Worst experience - returning a product and waiting for refund.

2021,Great!!,5
2021,Best app for learning,5
2021,"It's a good app with decent discounts but some basic things are amiss: #1 The refunds take ages #2 you cannot add a product to your wishlist from your purchases section neither can you view whether it's available in another size or not #3 they don't tell you the models height and the size of the garment they're wearing, which is a given nowadays. #4 What is up with the pant lengths? Nearly all legwear is short for me even at maximum size (I'm 6'2"") If they rectify these, the brand's pretty cool",3
2021,"The chat doesn't work at all,the customer service sucks!they doesn't reply at all when my package of 71 dollars order lost.I would never buy neither recommend zara again!!!!the order showed delivered but never arrived!they do nothing!neither refund nor replacement!never buy Zara!",1
2021,Good,4
2021,I made a purchase and it said the items would be sent within 1 week. I waited for more than a month for them to be delivered. It never came. Then it was cancelled without giving me any notice beforehand after more than 5 weeks. Customer Service kept changing their responses when given inquiries as to the order. Overall it's quite a bad online shopping experience,1
2021,Too expensive,1
2021,Please add dark mode,3
2021,"Only US services, stupid...",1
2021,Bad,1
2021,Good app. More options than most physical stores,4

2021,"This is the best app for shopping. It has many items to shop. Keeps sale, discount and many more things to shop. Can't think what to shop but pls try to reduce the cost of all things. I rate this app . Easy to use.",5
2021,Okay but the layout is slightly confusing. There is no option to sort (e.g. price low to high) which is annoying.,3

2021,Good,4
2021,"Pathetic app with only good photos and when you use it its actually useless. Your pathetic after sales support staff in India extremely rude, your return policy takes almost a monthwhich is of medieval period, the app doesnt have correct modules and features. Very disappointing 😞",1

2021,"Awful experience. Something is really wrong with this app, in 1 second all the items from the basket are missing , till you write the numbers to pay with the card, should not be allowed after you are at THAT stept to put your card numbers and pay someone else to take the items from your basket. Is wrong.waist off time everytime to buy something with this app",1

2021,"Everytime Zara Egypt launches a sale, you can never purchase an item because sizes are removed. Also, certain items can never be purchased online, they tell you item does not exist in here then, you go to the shop and they have it. It's like they do not have control over the merchandise. And, pretend to call directly to the shop? Forget it, they rarely pick up the phone. In general, the appilcation in this country is terrible!",2

2021,Ugly fashion sense and the camera quality of the photo is worse than my phone camera quality so don't get this app,1
2021,"Annoying shopping. No use for using filter. For example, I select I need only S size clothes and it shows items that are out of that size.",1
2021,Good,5
2021,"Disappointing because I went through items during the sale season, but on checkout, I was informed that all items in my basket are out of stock.. Very misleading. This doesn't happen though for regular items. Lately too, hadn't joy been able to open the app",2

2021,Very good 👌👍😊,5
2021,Bad,1
2021,I had to write a well deserved review it was the first time I have ordered items of clothing from Zara unbelievable how professional fast and helpfull they were the quality of the clothing was something else and when I had to change an item they sent a courier to collect it the day after what can I say a pleasant surprise and I can guarantee that Zara are on top of their game,5
2021,It's good but the only thing which is bad that is delivery charges.,5
2021,Fully satisfied with the quality of products .,5

2021,Really good,5
2021,"This is such an amazing shopping experience, love it. Their stuff are even better in person than on the photos. Had many orders arrive so quickly as promised. They also charge me only when items are send.So far this has been so satisfying considering all the lock down and shops closed.",5

2021,Horrible,1
2021,Zara is my live my whole closet is zara sometimes my friends come over they say your closet is not closet its shopping it called zara I have everything from them my shoes everything i love it it's my live I always be stylish whith Zara,5

2021,Horrible te cobran las cosas te hacen esperar 15 dias y luego te dicen qur no podran mandarte el producto,1
2021,All the things in sale are in stock.,2
2021,If I can give less than one I will do it . I returned items with 450 dirhams .And they did not send my money back . This is really the worst experience with a brand like Zara .,1
2021,Always face problem and frod against return,1
2021,My packages got cancelled twice because of faulty coding in the app. They also made a mistake in inventory and I did not get all the products that I ordered. On top of that I called to inquire about the mistake and they only excuse was ' well it was a mistake' no apologies or any way to compensate their mistakes. My package has yet to arrive. The worst customer service and their is a total lack of actual SERVICE done.,1
2021,Worst app ever. So i ordered a skirt from zara on 25 th dec and now it's 15 feb. I don't even remember how many times I have called zara. But they ain't doing a thing about it. Don't order from zara. They don't give your money back if you return something. Worst customer service ever.,1
2021,Very bad experience,1
2021,"Older version was better , now m not able to buy anything from sale.",1
2021,New updated version really sucks. Can't even check out how the product looks like. The model is sitting and covering the whole dress and the worst part is that is the ONLY picture 🤦🏻‍♀️,1

2021,"DIDN'T EXPEXT THIS FROM ZARA,these people play with customers feelings by showing the product available,when you add the product to the cart it suddenly shows that this product is unavailable and if we ask any information about the product to the customer care they will say that we don't have any details about the product, worst service..",1
2021,"I ordered a pair of boots for my son, I found inside a used tissue, with the green staff on it..! I didn't ask for nothing, just told them things like this not to happen to someone else...and they blocked my account 😒 very disappointed!!",1

2021,Absolutely my favourite app,5
2021,I made a mistake while ordering 3 products from Zara. So I called them up and asked them to cancel it and refund the money since I paid through Google pay. This happened December 2020 and till now I haven't received my money. I trusted Zara thinking that its international and will be professional. But it was so useless I have been calling them since last 3 week still no response all they say is I understand and it's a technical issue. Like how many weeks do they need to fix that technical issue?,1
2021,"So many bugs, especially the chat system",1
2021,Am giving this app a 5star!!!!!! 😍,5
2021,Bad,1

2021,"I love Zara clothes however I find the sizes inconsistent and there are no reviews or indicators to say whether an item is true to size, comes up large or small. Also there are limited sometimes badly posed photos where the model is sitting/lying down so it can be difficult to gauge the clothes so sometimes I love an item but get the size wrong.",3
2021,The sale items difficult to know whitch are still available. Also sometimes the model too much acting and we cannot see the items clearly.,3
2021,"Not having customer reviews makes it more difficult to make decisions when ordering. With stores closed, this is a big issue.",2

2021,My order is so late,1
2021,The art director for the app needs to be shot or hung the way this app flows is HORRIBLE why am I looking at the same items in after scrolling past them ? There is no organization in this app. If your looking at a blue button down shirt and it comes in multiple colors and then scroll across to other styles of shirts after maybe 4 swipes you will come across the same blue button down shirt but its in brown instead. Just have all color next to each other when you scroll. Terrible app flow.,2
2021,Sehr gut app mit billiger preise,5

2021,"Is it so difficult to understand in parts of Europe we don't pay with credit cards but with debit which require some sort of authorisation outside of the app for security?

2021,Love the Clothes a lot,5
2021,"Browsing and shopping is easy. No reviews are posted. Returns information is not great. No summary of how much you'll get back, very minimal information. Also the tracking is super weird. I sent back 5 boxes and FedEx is only showing 1. I hope this works out!",2
2021,Zara is a disgrace when it comes to online shopping. It allows you to put items in your basket and when you ho checkout items is out of stock or when you to to pay now it tells you items are out of stock whole processing payment. Zara should allow items to be in your basket for at least 30 minutes while you look at other items to purchase. I should really go to the newspapers with this.,1
2021,I cannot pay everytime I go to checkout the payment method won't load I made sure it's up to date and tried website instead of the app but still won't load!,1
2021,"Really easy to use and site is set out well. The fun starts when you select a size add it to your basket, go to buy iy and it's not available. Definitely not a one off, happens all the time! Never happened before, wasting my time especially since we can't go to shops right now, so relying on online purchases!",3
2021,Click and collect information is not available it may take up to couple of weeks for items to be delivered in shop to be collected it is absolutely annoying.,1
2021,"Every time I add something to the basket The next thing I see is ""out of stock"" WITHIN A SECOND 💩 PREVIOUS version was A LOT BETTER",1
2021,Cancelan pedidos por falta de stock.,2
2021,Over priced😔🙁,1
2021,Amazing appp... Just gone love with it❤,5
2021,My experience in getting refund back from Zara inditex is the WORST. waiting for my refund from November 2020. They don't provide any phone no. for complaint in India and even they don't provide any email so that we can complaint through that. Only live chat is available and their corrospondents don't satisfy a single querry of you.Totally mere wastage.That 's why i'm sharing that you will face problems in refund. So shop on your own risk.,1
2021,It's absolutely shame suche good made stuff should sale like this! most products are different comper to standard sizes and there's no clear description special when you can't try them on. I have orders £1000 and all trousers were short!! For how many years you want to make short trousers?,1
2021,Best experience ever 💗💗,5

KURIR MANA MAU TAU KALO RESI INVALID.. INI HR ZARA REKRUT CS DARI APASIH? TURUN JAUH IMAGE BRAND LO!!",1

2021,Really needs to give you time to purchase a product when it's in your basket. Very very frustrating.,2

2021,"Great application, however few things could make it better - alerts when your saved item/item in the basket is available in your size, more categories for easier browsing (eg. Coats as a different category than jackets and blazers)",4
2021,Very good,5
2021,"Absolutely useless. I was ordering lots of clothing, but no more!! Since updating the app 3 days ago I can no longer buy anything in the sale. Everything is out of stock. You get your hopes up that the items say instock, then you get to basket and checkout and it says ""out of stock"" or ""not in your geographic area"". Why????? Seriously disappointing and a waste of time!! A website with sale pages that you cannot buy anything from! Don't like the new changes made to the website too.",1
2021,Nothing to buy everything is coming soon and it never comes.,1
2021,Ok excellent condition 😉,5
2021,"The app is AMAZING ! Perfectly organized HOWEVER the coming soon issue un Algeria is making the whole ZARA experience a total nightmare! I have introduced it to 5 of my friends and we all suffer from that!!! Dont know where the problem lies, but kindly fix ASAP cz we d love to buy your stuff you know!",3
2021,The best ever,5
2021,Very bad experiance not included United arab emirates in the region to register also not reflct products on the region,1
2021,Will be better if like the old version the App showed items that has been requested for return ie crossed out or item requested to be returned . Also needs to show which store the item has been ordered for delivery. At moment you have to go into the order item to check. Old app showed on the purchase screen.,3
2021,"Since the last update, can't use the app",1
2021,"Poor. Size guides font load and have errors. The menu and home page are not intuitive. The photos are taken more for visual appeal rather than to showcase the item, how it sits, what it looks like on and off models so its very hard to get a sense of the product.",2
2021,Total farce,1
2021,Love the app,5
2021,Utterly not clear from which / to which regions app can be used. Do I need to find a store in my area to use the app? Is this an online purchasing app or a catalog? Not clear at all.,1

2021,"It is really frustrating to shop on this app! Items show as available, let me add item into the basket, go to checkout straight away and it says ""out of stock"". It did not happen just to one item. I have noticed Zara puts items in various sizes through out the day/week but now it's nearly impossible to purchase items I want. Feels like lottery shopping! It has great potential as others said but this is big let down for such a big brand!",1
2021,Good,4
2021,"Zara India app.. Worst ..there is no way to track your returned items..and there are a lot of problems in the bank and ifsc selection menu, if you want refund in your bank account..look into that some serious problems are there...

2021,i love this app,5
2021,"The app is user friendly. I am particularly impressed with the variety in the kiddies section. However, I am not pleased with how Zara handles orders. I've been waiting since the 15th of January 2021 for some of my items which were split, the date now is the 5th of February 2021 and Aramex is also no good. I was also double billed for my first purchase, which caused a huge inconvenience but the money was returned within 14 days.",2

2021,Not a fan of the upgrade!,2
2021,It's clunky and awkward. The filters never work unlike every other site I've used. It doesn't remove out of stock goods from the page only at POS. Useless.,1

Second of all, when you select an item, you go straight to the basket and it is not available, but if you go to the item again you still can select it again. Did good 30 minutes making a basket of 500 euros, but when I enter the basket I was left with things worth 35!!! Honestly, waste of time. I was so excited at first and now I feel like smashing the phone, app, bank card, all of it!!!",1

2021,My experience with zare is awful. I got email from zara on 20 January that my order in the store was recieved but when I went for collection after waiting for half an hour one of the customer assistant said we haven't recieved it yet. Now its been 13 am still waiting.,1
2021,"Brilliant app for my favorite shop, love it!",5
2021,I lose you app somewhere between my sourcing for filling up my store in between Pandeglang-Bekasih. Sorry but i can borrow from my sister😁,2
2021,Gud,3

2021,Good experience.....zara fashion is like food....,5
2021,Gud,5
2021,Don't order these people don't deliver and don't refund as well,1
2021,"Awful user navigation, would not accept my postcode or enter my address correctly for ordering, stuff in basket out of stock, very tedious experience",1
2021,Easy to use but poor at keeping stock upto date. Even when you have added items to basket they then go out of stock when you move on to payment! If an item is in my basket it should be made unavailable to anyone else until I confirm payment. If I had it in my hand in a shop you wouldn't allow someone to come and take it off me!,2
2021,Nice app,4
2021,"Awful app. It crashes all the time, I can't even browse normally for more than few minutes. I'd better keep using the website.",1
2021,coprative,5
2021,the app is not working! I have some returns to make and it's imposible!,1
2021,In sale season they limit collect free from store dont let me buy to make free collection. Really????,1
2021,"Spend ages browsing and adding to cart only to find when you go to the basket either most of the items actually aren't available (out of stock or not available in your geographical location??) OR worse, the basket resets to ZERO ITEMS ADDED! ALSO.. annoying to be half way through a category, click an item for a closer look then close the item and watch as the screen scrolls all the way back to the top of the category! So you have to manually sit and scroll 20 or 30 screens down to get back",2
2021,Happy,5
2021,Not responding,1
2021,"Refund functionality is very confusing. When Email is received to complete refund, there is a link that takes you to the screen with the full order and then you have to find where to type your information for the refund which is not very intuitive. It should take user directly to the screen where you need to type the information for the refund.",3
2021,They stole money from my account twice .....don't do it!!!,1
2021,Shipping charge is too much.🙏 Reduce shipping charge 🙏,1
2021,So disappointing with the app. No just myself. A few my friends stop ordering clothes online. I spent 50 minutes to fill in my basket with clothes. When I finished my shopping and ready to complete my purchase most of the clothes wasn't available. I don't want to shop anymore because its a waist of time to choose something is available but after 5 minutes no availability. Why other shop save your clothes in the basket for at least one hour. Definitely disappointed with zara online shopping.,1
2021,Gud,5

2021,I love it! no doubts. 👍🏻☺️,5
2021,"It's exceptionally buggy (after the UI change). I buy a significant amount of my clothes from Zara and Zara Srpls. But this time, all of my pants got changed to L from XL. I don't even know how this could happen. Thankfully, Zara has a good customer service in Japan. So I think they will let me exchange these for the right size (I had a similar problem before). Furthermore, the shipping tracking that's inside the app is all wrong too. It seems like the new app Ui is messing everything up.",1
2021,Great,5
2021,The app randomly logged me out. I'm unable to login again.,3
2021,Good,5
2021,I am so disappointed with their return policy. Customer associates assurance are not helpful in any way. My return item is pending from 6th January till date.,1

2021,User friendly. Love it,5
2021,"The recent update doesn't work well. When I click into a specific item, then decide to go back, it scrolls all the way back to the top. Whereas before, when I went back, I was able to continue browsing where I left off.",1
2021,Cool,5
2021,"Being from Pamplona, Spain, I have a soft spot for Zara. This app works well enough for me, because I have been a Zara client for years & I have a pretty good idea on how they size their clothes. Also this app explains well how to make returns, if needed; as well as exchanges.",4
2021,Perfect for online shopping 🛍👌,5
2021,"In last month it was ok to buy items, but has become a waste of time and stressfull to atempt selection, the app show items available to select and in checkout its not available anymore. Of i go to the items its still available to pick. It would ve great if you couldnt select in the first place. Ive had 10 items in this situation just now, and customer support Eden was not professional he was sarcastic. Not happy customer this time.",2
2021,"Spend hours choosing items that when selecting says available, and then in cart it's not anymore in stock you go back and it's available again... It's a waste of time if you can't rely on the information.",2

2021,Horrendous customer service. Deleted.,1
2021,Worst customer service I have ever experienced are those of ZARA. Product returned and waiting now for my refund amount from last 10-15 days but no update. I tried my best to reach them on ZARA app but after hi hello they disable the chat. They are not even worthy for single star,1
2021,Crashes too often. In purchases items bought don't show. Only can only see amount paid at times,2
2021,Nice 👍,5
2021,It's awful...every product is out of stock since ages..................and it's not convenient to use...,1

2021,I like the product and the quality but problem in refunding and it takes too long,5
2021,I loved the app and i have no bad experience yet.,5
2021,"As many other comments below I must fully agree: Since the new update a few days ago, my app is not functioning at all, can not open anything. Uninstall/install, still nothing. Not to mention trying to return an item (within those 1,5 days that app worked) which is now a nightmare in comparison with an old app. From the user experience point of view this has just been a major issue. Zero points.",1
2021,Zara does not deliver items paid for.,1
2021,"Nice app, however not fully functional. When accessing /logging in asking for location, after having placed products in the shopping basket upon checking out most items are ""not available in your region"". If product availability would match location, then thr shopping experience would be good. Under the current system settings I was unfortunately unable to successfully check out or purchase anything. It's a loss both for company and customer. Maybe some aspects can be improved. Thank you.",2
2021,Its good quality.,5
2021,❤️,5
2021,"Worst app, they don't refund on time neither nearby. They initiated the refund on 22nd Jan 2021 and said you will receive it in next 24/48 hours. Now its 28th Jan and when I contacted zara customer care the executive is sick there they now say it will take again next 7 - 14 days. What a mismanagement in such reputed companies. Don't buy online guys.",1
2021,"I love Zara style and fashions. But online this purchasing is very bad experience for me. My order takes very long before it comes i have ordered a lot, a lot around 35 pcs. due to sizes down. And i really needed badly. But until now i only received 5pcs the annoying things is the basket of purchasing didn't come together. In one basket i have purchased on 1 came and the other basket is 3 it's mix. I couldn't have be nice if 1 basket you purchased will come in one package.",1
2021,A very convenient way to purchase from zara ... like the interface and payment options....,5
2021,"The most pathetic service ever! Whats worst is these guys don't even care. Placed an order almost a month ago n dint receive it, was assured a refund but its been 20 days and despite follow ups these people fail to give me the transaction ID. If zara doesn't intend to refund it shouldn't be assured at the first place. Its very very very sad to see this kind of service from such a huge brand!",1
2021,Good experience with zara online shopping app,5
2021,It doesn't deliver in some location and require a fast network,3
2021,It freezes and shuts down and afterwards it restarts and all your options disappear and you have to start from the beginning of your search. It is frustrating every 10 minutes to do that.,2
2021,👍,5
2021,Very difficult to use while you want to return smthng,2
2021,"Best app ever, but u should have a customer help center in SA but when I needed help I got it.",5
2021,Worst app all time searching searching can't add my article it's stuck all the time horrible app,1
2021,Horrible UX. I placed an order on the app and one of the items was missing. I had to call Zara who sent me to check with the carrier. I have sent all necessary information but i can't track my reimbursement or the status of my ticket. Better go to the store.,1

2021,Spoken to over 5 Zara assistants for one simple return for over a month with no direct answer. Wouldn't recommend.,1
2021,This app is horrible . I shop online a lot and I must say Zara Online is the worst. I keep getting rerouted to the main page when I try to conclude my payment. And why does it take an entire week for the delivery to arrive?,1
2021,"Big fan of Zara, love their clothes especially for my lil ones.",5
2021,"In sale time you cannot find any item to order, there is no available on stock even if they are on site and selling. Such a waste of time.",2

2021,"Application has a bug that disables return process. It's not possible to enter personal data, neither to submit the return form. Images in the purchase are appearing incorrectly, as well as prices. Once when switched to another app, this app repeals whatever is done, the preview, or purchase, or attempt to return, even though it is not closed yet.

2021,"When ordering if it happened there are items coming form UK seems they would cancel your order without notice whatsoever, even in the tracking tab shows like being sent.

I give 0 for this new app. pleased bring back the previous app. Thank you",5
2021,Ordering through this app is a complete nightmare because they put damaged items inside and i have to go all the way to the physical shop in order to return it. Chat is always unavailable. I tried sending an email also. NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE! Njerez te papergjegjshem.,1

2021,Why u make sale and put photos and all items out of stock and coming soon that's so bad,1
2021,Not able to order,1
2021,Good 👍,3
2021,Chat box is the worst communication for customer service.,1
2021,The app needs to be uploaded right now!!!!!! It does so inconvenient stuff .. like scrolling back to top every time i go back Ugh !!!,1
2021,Easy to work with,5

2021,"Terrible, it never updated so my clothes got sent back to warehouse. Plus chat is not great either. Many issues with this app and brand.",1
2021,So simple to use I love it,5
2021,The worst site ever. Esp on returns. Will never use again,1
2021,Impossible to update /delete address with this app and can only be done by typing zara on google(upon advice from a friend). Misled by customer services to uninstall the app then reinstall it to be able to change address which didn't work. An automatic error occurred and my order was shipped to the wrong address. I got no refund so a stranger is in possession of my parcel.,1
2021,I honestly don't think this app is catered to people on their phone. The user experience is absolutely horrible. Bookmarked items don't appear unless you click on the item and go into it's page - if you try bookmark while scrolling through items it won't save. I also tried to contact someone regarding a return and I cant send my message on the 24 hour chat because the send has been grayed out. They chat text input box also seems delayed. Too many issues and bugs with this app.,3
2021,"Except for purchase no other tab works .customer service is the worst. In case of return, bank account details just cannot be uploaded at all.",1
2021,Grosse améliorations visible et dark mode enfin sur ios. Nickel !,5
2021,Order it came wuthin 2 days,5
2021,"New app if just awful. Before I could see all my purchases together with photos next to them, so it was easy to find every order. Now Zara removed pictures, so when you open purchases, the only thing you see is lots of order numbers, and if you want to send return request you have to go through each order to find the right order you want to return. I buy a lot from Zara and it will be hell to find correct order in this mess.. very disappointed, I would give 0 stars if I could.",1
2021,nice so much,5
2021,"The app is very limited, there no way to change anything when a mistake occur or while shopping late at night while the customer service is close...No way to get help right the way",3
2021,Always there was something wrong to reback my information and contents and my purchases on this bad zara android... Veryyyyy bad in online deals..,1
2021,Perfect,3
2021,Amazing app,5
2021,The latest update has really broken the UI of the app. Terrible decision to change it from the UI that you previously had.,3
2021,"Very poor customer service. The latest update is even worse, the chat does not work. If you want to make a purchase and pick it up from a store of your vicinity, the stores list is not active, no stores appear.",2
2021,"Extremely difficult to use your app, there is no obvious platform straight to the return item, every time have to your customers service to solve it out. You should look at other big companies's web sites, like Amazon. They are simple and easy, in order to reduce your customer service pressure.",1
2021,All i got to say is.. Ew,1
2021,A good selection of items easy to use and value for money,5
2021,Very nice,5
2021,Why all items are out of stock it doesn't make sense,1
2021,"The only thing I would change is to enable users to add more items to the shopping bag that hasn't been prepared yet. So, if I buy a shirt and want to buy another one a couple of hours later with the bag not being prepared, I can add the next one and get them in the same package.",5
2021,Worst experience ever. Once u cancel the order they will never refund ur money back. Its more than 1.5 months and i am struggling to get my money back...,1

Ive ordered through the app umpteen timed and found no problems with it at all. My items Arrived on time in great packaging. What didn't suit, I used free return drop off and Got my refund within a few days.",5

2021,Good,4
2021,I didn't like the material so I returned it but what??? They don't refund my shipping charges of Rs 290...It was like I am doing a charity to Zara ...Never ever shop from this app,1
2021,Does not work you can't add anything on the cart,1
2021,I don't even feel like giving this a one freaking star. The app totally sucks. I uninstalled this app for a couple of months as I was not having anything to do with it and installed it today itself Nd the app does not let me see the products. It has alot of bugs ahhhh... I tried refreshing it but it did not load which just makes me upsets Nd annoyed! Do something with this please.,1
2021,It's been more than two months and these people still haven't refunded me. Worst experience ever!,1
2021,Very good app,5
2021,Glitches on the app caused my card to be charged multiple times without any orders going through. Managed to get it sorted but you're probably safest just going online on a web browser.,2
2021,"Appaling items in basket input card details, then said items not available and took 8 minutes for it to select a delivery of choice",1
2021,The sizes for different categories you get are not in accordance to what you see on the models so it gets really frustrating at times when you receive the order. Overall app functionalities are pretty smooth.,3
2021,Will never shop here ever again! I didn't recieve updates on the status of my order until two days before it arrived (after I asked them about it of course). Then they attempted to withdraw the money from my account twice(luckily that account was empty). After reading reviews I thought I'd never recieve my order.,1
2021,App is perfect.. under image filter I am not able to select image or use the capture option. Plz help.,4
2021,App too slow. It won't load anything,1

2021,"Consumer with ZARA for many years, and they have improved vastly. App is brilliant, design, photos, style, info. Recent times have been tough for retailers, lock down, shopping on line, courier services struggling with volume of consumers purchasing and returning. ZARA are so organised, recognised courier backlog, utilised more couriers , kept me informed return process throughout, . Chat service with Dianne, marvellous, she was extremely helpful.",5

2021,"App login doesn't work, login works on browser but when trying on application it says user doesn't exist",1

Tried to chat again but had to sign out n start again. Said it would refer me to 'human being' as it couldn't understand where do I find size chart. Said wait one moment then blocked again as said I was inactive???? Give up.... Will delete app n wait for stores to open.. Quite typical response for zara.. Customer help in store lacking,1

2021,They never update your return status. Also product will disappear from the shopping list post cancelling the payment. Customer support chat deactivates immediately in 20 secs if not typed anything. Also my refund amount of 5k is stuck and they are not updating the status on app or not even sending any email after majing multiple complaints. Poorest experience. Don't even deserve 1 star rating also.. It should be in minus.,1
2021,Everything is fine!,5
2021,They are fraud . I have returned my order and they are not refunding me and not replying me on Gmail. And their customer care number is all not valid . I will never shop again and I suggest u all to not shop from here . And the quality difference is alot in their products . #fraud,1

2021,"Worst online shopping experience. Delivery dates are false promises, trying to contact is frustrating and the attention received poor in information.

2021,"Order was never sent, i emailed customer service to ask why i did not receive it by the timeline stated, they kept saying it is under process and did not tell me when it will be received, I order on Zara app in Dubai and there is never any issue, here in Lebanon i would never think of ordering online again..",1

2021,"Hello. Please decide and take action. Picking up trousers for myself I stopped at one price tag on them was 1990 r. And at the checkout they tell me that I need to pay 2990 rubles. Motivating that we mixed up the price tags. Naturally, it angered me. Arriving the next day, they also hung at a price of 1990 p. and were hung one pair at a time throughout the hall. Tolyatti. As I understand this is not the first time.",2

First said the order number I gave was wrong, then once I uploaded the screenshot from the email from Zara he agreed the order existed!! Then he kept me on hold for 10 minutes and then cut the line!!!! Tried again, same nonsense with another person!!!!!! They cancelled 2 of the 4 items by themselves, and forgot about the refunds?

2021,I didn't get my refund yet. It is pending from last two months. I have talked to you people like several times and all you do is nothing. It is the customer's money which you are supposed to refund them.,1
2021,"This a online platform to sell not demanding and fail products of zara. Ufcource they advertise good stuff also during sell time or without but, all the time good stuff is out of stock. only, those products avalable which is not popular and zara couldn't sell it.

2021,Very bad customer service...the chat option takes forever to respond and when i get bored of waiting and leave the app for a min they'll just close the conversation saying i was away for a while...like how annoying! I'm not so fluent in English hence i chose the option hindi every time i contact their customer service but these people can't understand hindi!...then why do you give us an option for English and hindi then?... pathetic service..my refund is still processing.,1

2021,"I have been waiting for my refund for over 2 months now. Whenever I call customer services they tell me that they will look into it and initiate the refund, needless to say they do absolutely nothing about it. This has been going on for over a month now.

2021,Very bad app.misplaced my order even several times I called them up but no reply at all..I lost my money as well as products,1
2021,"The worst customer service ever. The chat service is clearly run by robots, who only bring in human workers at the last minute to pull out your order number and then then the chat deactivates if there is even a minute of inactivity, most of which is caused by the customer service being so slow to reply. I haven't gotten my refund for the past 3 weeks, and I've received no help from Zara.",1
2021,Ordered something as it is available in store after a week they cancelled my order without sending me an email or anything. I contacted them to know why my order was cancelled they said that it was out of stock in warehouse. Won't use the app again,1

2020,"This app is strange to say the least. You can easily view an item that displays a cute shirt/blouse and upon continuing to scroll on that item to find the deets on the bottoms, it goes far left telling you what would go well with that shirt.

2020,Awesome,5
2020,"From a brand like Zara one expects better. The app is very poorly conceptualized with basic features like Cancelling an order, deleting an old saved address missing from it. When brands choose to have their own app and not sell it on 3rd party platforms like Myntra, they should atleast design apps that are equally good if not better. Pathetic experience using the Zara app.",1
2020,Can't login,1
2020,Won't let you search for a specific item. Very frustrating!!,2
2020,"I don't received what I order, instead I got wrong product, when I complained about wrong products they don't want to pick up wrong product and no refund, in the first place its zara mistake that they packed wrong items. Its very easy to put up an order but when we got the wrong items it's so difficult to return the item. So from my point of view online shopping is a kinda fraud , now I will file against zara to consumer complaint .",1
2020,"User friendly, Return process is so easy also via this app. I have been using it for 7 times purchased. The quality of the picture is clear, the description of the material also clear. The administration behind this app can be seen working a very good job 👍👍 Satisfied customer",5

Do not know how you made it here where you are now, but certainly do not deserve this popularity status!",1

2020,Fantastic,5
2020,"Could be a really good and helpful app, however, there are so many bugs in the stock checks that it makes it almost unusuable. You add an item to your bag which is clearly in stock, go to your bag and it's marked as out of stock, go back to the item and it says its in stock again. Incredibly frustrating as you have to go round and round in circles on the app and can't even end up buying anything. Also the search results are clearly broken as you can't scroll the full results.",2

2020,"I ordered £100 worth of clothes, which never got delivered. Zara claims that the parcel has been delivered even though nobody signed for the package because couriers self-sign due to covid, and refused the refund or store credit. So I disputed this through my bank, the first time I have EVER had to do that. Zara was my go-to brand and after this I'm never shopping there again.",1

2020,The UI is very unresponsive and also the product availability is different on website and on app.,1
2020,I like the ease of scanning the barcodes of the clothes i like in the store then being able to bookmark them in the app. I just wish they didn't sell out of practically everything when they have a sale. Because I'm never able to get the items i want when i see it finally discounted.,5
2020,"Very bad experience i had with app also with customer care 1st time ever to have such incident That i can't log in or access my account for as a pop up message shows error whenever i try to log in and issue unsolved 2nd when contacting customer care i was informed no such email registered with zara under this mail even after i sent customer agent screenshots of emails received from zara with order numbers, order confirmations and also E tickets and no action was taken ( poor c/care )",1

2020,Best internet shopping interface on the market,5
2020,The people from this chat disconnect on purpose because they have delays on their deliveries. Instead of helping you they tell you to cancel the order. Would rate less than one star.,1

They leave you for minutes with no reply, and the replies are not helpful by any means, it feels like you're talking to a bot! Order not delivered a week after the latest estimated delivery time [until now] and does not look to be delivered anytime soon, and I have a plane to catch!",1
2020,Zara has payment gateway issues never got my refund . I placed an order two months ago and zara uses CITRUS payment solutions in india which is duping people of their money. A simple process like refund should happen automatically . Because of zara using citrus pay they hold on to people's money . Plus reaching out to zara using chat and calls is also hard . No one replies in chats. And they do not have an email facility. This is one of the biggest retail chains and they don't have email !lol,1
2020,Horrible service,1

2020,"Most of collection is coming soon, and you never receive an email when it is available so disappointing.",1
2020,Nothing is secure in your cart. It's literally sold out while your shopping. I put items in and go to checkout and items are sold out. How is that possible when it was available and in my cart (smh). This bugged should be fixed. I shouldn't have to rush to purchase so things do get taken out of my cart while shopping. This is just silly if you ask me. Zara should wait until the buyer is finished purchase to put the item back into the system as item available.,1
2020,The most badly experienc you can get,1
2020,Worst experience with this app.... They have cancelled my order without even asking me and now they are saying that they cannot do anything .... Just worst service and worst app ever .....,1

2020,"I had placed an order for couple of perfumes from the app. The delivery was returned citing ""package was damaged"". While trying to contact the customer service, the customer support agent ""Jane"" was not at all helpful. They claimed that delivery was unsuccessful due to some issue in the delivery process or area entry restrictions. They were initiating a refund, while I had asked for shipping of the original order again, to which they said it's not possible. 10/10 WILL NOT RECOMMENDED !",1

2020,I placed through the app on 26th November during the Black Friday Sale. Wanted to gift my brother on his birthday. The delivery was expected b/w 1st to 9th December. Had been waiting patiently. And on 4th December I get a mail that my order has been cancelled due to lack of availablity. I had been looking at the same product daily and my size had always been available. Why did you guys accept my order if you had no intention to deliver it. Pathetic customer service.,1
2020,"It's been very annoying which is sad to say, I had returned a product and haven't received my refund, it's been a month now. The customer care services are beyond poor, no one replies on the chat and the telephone service are worthless, even if they reply or answer the call no action has been taken whatsoever. It's very careless for such a good brand. I am very dissatisfied and annoyed.",1

Please make both the app and website user friendly. It's a weird disjoined website coupled with the occassional bug. This is also without mention of the bizarre photos of the clothing. Again, trying to be innovative yet taking a step back.I'd rather go in store as online shopping has never been so inconvenient.",1
2020,Horrible for payment methods. I paid around 20k and the amount got deducted but the purchase did not go through.,1

The customer service told that we refunded amount to the provided account. when I ask them the transition number they told me to visit your 'X' bank, at this moment I was totally shocked because I gave the account details of 'Y' bank and there was no account of mine in 'X' bank.

So I don't know what went wrong with Zara app. I gave up, uninstalled it but hopefully my review helps.",2

2020,"It would be easier to buy if the app has clear options such as high to low, low to high price, and filter to show special priced items. For eg, searching leather shows shoes & bags both. Then there is no sub-category of price low to high, most relevant, Type of item (shoes OR bag), etc.",3
2020,This app is just worst. They can't deliver on time when you order something and when you inquire you only get same answer everyday. And don't address your issues properly. They might be cheating because I ordered a top and I don't get it delivered till today. Worst shopping experience ever,1
2020,No sirve,1
2020,Love it ❤️,5

2020,من ثلاث شهور رجعت مشتريات ويماطلون في إرجاع المبلغ.,1
2020,What's wrong with the delete/buy later option in the shopping cart? It had been working alright so far.,3
2020,"Very poor experience when it comes to return request ,no tracker available in application for return pickup and for customer service there is a chat option which looks like a great option but is actually not coz no quick service will be received even if they commit you to provide ,no confirmation ,no call back request can be made and when it comes to dealing with the help option no actual help",1
2020,Its such a poor app not able to login even. I will 1 rating only. I wanted to buy something for me but its a worse app now. I think the user is not having intrest to re develop this app. Kindly check your mail,1

2020,Good,4
2020,Bad application,1
2020,"In general is fine. The first shopping was successful, but now I can't delete items from my basket. I reinstalled my app and the problem hasn't disappeared, so I can't continue my shopping with items that for some reason I don't want anymore. It would be nice if someone fix this. Thank you",3
2020,"Not a great phone app experience. Trying to find the things you want is a chore. Take a note from the other Clothing retail apps like Asos, River Island etc... no need to over complicate it.",2
2020,I can not update or edit my shopping cart! It is annoying. Its been 3 days Ive been trying to place an order. The things out of stock... I can't delete them!!!,1
2020,All items are almost out of stock in Egypt!!!,1
2020,"very very bad and frustrating chat service, it ends after minutes without respond, you should make a call to get the help, and you always wait for at least 20 minutes to be answered, there's a problem editting your shopping bag, i can't delete or ""buy later"", and its not fixed since 4 days ago.",3
2020,How to delete from the shopping bag in this app ???,1
2020,Good app and excellent zara products. Love it. Finally zara is online.,5

2020,Cool app,5
2020,Terrible market place app,2
2020,Doesn't load photos. Always issues finding items on this app.,1
2020,Amazing design of an aplication shows well enough why zara is a loud name,5
2020,Please upgrade your size charts with garment measurements,4
2020,"The most complicated, ridiculous, mind boggling shopping experience ever. Trying to cancel something out of your shopping bag is so much harder than anything should ever be. Ever.",1
2020,"The chat is not good, can communicate with their Customer service representatives, not by phone, chat or email. No answer received. Only works well to place the orders and receive emails to confirm order and payment. Very disappointed.......",2
2020,Unable to register via the app.,3
2020,"Not very quick in updating stocks. Unavailable stocks should be removed as misleading to customers. Also, i receive emails saying that item is now back in stock but when i visit the site item is still unavailable.",2
2020,Very poor customer service. Chat sales assistants are very poor and unhelpful.,1
2020,Should definitely update the app by adding some more filters,2
2020,"It won't let me update payment details. Can't receive sms code needed. Automated chat (grrrr) told me to reinstall app, it is the new app!",1
2020,"The best ""Find my size"" option I've seen ever in any app. Thankyou👑",5
2020,Have you ever tried to buy a Zara perfume online? Good luck. Very embarrassing to have that kind of online services for such a big company.,1
2020,Lovely collection 💞,5
2020,Difficult to do shopping,1
2020,Prices are to high,2
2020,Favorite app,5
2020,"It's not made for phones, but for browsers instead. Design decisions make it hard to use and everything that you need to be at first sight is located somewhere in the menus. The support is ridiculous, because when I had problem with the functionality(I couldn't edit the order) they just told me to reinstall the app.",1
2020,Extremely frustrating cart experience. Cannot remove items once they're there.,1
2020,❤,5
2020,"Excellent for browsing purposes, simple and clean cut graphics. Visually very pleasing.",5
2020,I really don't know what's the point of making an app to shop online when every item you select is not available!!! Not only new collection but the on sale items will never use it again I've been trying since a year,1
2020,I just love your designs,5
2020,Who doesn't love ZARA? 😍🥰,5
2020,Worst app,1
2020,"It doesn't show fragrances for South Africa, please add this as where I stay I can't access zara but I love the fragrances/perfumes. Otherwise it's a good app",4
2020,Worst app in the world. Learn to develop customer friendly app like Myntra.,1
2020,It's totally craziest brand I ever seen just,5
2020,By far one of my favorite baby & toddler girl shopping sites. Excellent quality!,5
2020,Very good. Easy use.,5
2020,Where's the sales part?,1
2020,"Very limited product selection or offering, not worth installing.",1
2020,"I think its better to go to the store any buy the stuff because i havent received a fresh product inspite of ordering it twice, poor packaging 👎👎",1
2020,Love,5
2020,"The cart empties after a few hours, Frustrating. Also, a time consuming format that makes browsing a lot of work. A chore to go back to re-ad items that disappeared.",1
2020,The chat is the only way to get some help but they simply close the chat everytime they want. It's exasperating. And some items in the favorites disappear even though they are available.,1
2020,"Didn't like it much. Filters have poor options to it and then I can not select the adress where I want it to get delivered, can not delete previous address . Too many fixes are needed",2
2020,i hd created my account bt failed to log in zara app.... r log in on site .... plz fix this issue,1
2020,You can't just click on coats or shoes you have to scroll through it all.,1
2020,"Simple, friendly user, quick service, only bad things, out of stock easily hahaha.",5
2020,It's dmmm 🔥,5
2020,It is not user friendly- navigation all over the place - do not like!,2
2020,Okay 👌,3
2020,My order has been delivered on Sunday.. don't know where the guy has delivered it. Haven't received any call. Just a code in the message. Which was I guess not required by the delivery guy. Since it has been delivered on Sunday so there was no customer care service and there is no way u can track it on app as it's showing delivered,1
2020,Bkwas,1
2020,woy Saya mau cancel orderan Saya tolong ????,1
2020,Very nice app,5
2020,"You are not answering on chat, I cannot reset my password because the message that i get in mail inbox doesn't have any instructions!",1

2020,👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,1
2020,"Poor App. For example, on filter criteria, why would I select short sleeve Jeans? Also, the fit/measurement guide is awful. So if I buy Jeans with a waist 34"" I get only leg length 34""? Trying to add to basket or view basket, your App is all over the place. Pages fly up or disappear before my eyes! Finally, I'm very unlikely to use your App to purchase on-line in it's current form.",2
2020,"Can't register, the page is non responsive.",2

2020,Unfriendly browsing experience,1
2020,Good,4
2020,They cancelled my order after 25 days. They couldn't figure out the product is out of stock and yet it appeared available in the app till 25 days. And the customer care guys have no information except for what's shown on the app. Zara should give up online shopping option. Pathetic.,1
2020,"Although the quality of items are good but I don't know how products of my wishlist just disappeared, now it's not showing. Very disappointing!",3
2020,Worst app,1
2020,My fav company,5
2020,"Pour une fois dans ce pays, Zara nous délivre un service digne des pays européens. Je suis extrêmement satisfait !",5
2020,They dnt solve customer's problem. Their number is always switched off and chat is useless. They take ages to ship,1
2020,تجربة سيئة جدا.. تم الشراء من المتجر اكثر من 6 قطع ملابس لكن وصلوا قطعة وحده بس وحاولت اتواصل معاهم بس للأسف ماعندهم أي وسيلة تواصل ولا جهة تقدر تراجع فيها، واذا رحت محلاتهم يقولوا مالنا علاقة بالمتجر الإلكتروني وادارته خارج السعودية. بعد بهدله ستة أشهر معاهم آخر شي رفعت عليهم شكوى في وزارة التجارة رجعوا لي فلوسي.,1
2020,Great app,5

2020,Excellent,5
2020,Just really awful. I want to browse all..... no easy way to do this other than using search feature what a horrible user experience and interface. Also why would you use black and white photos? I want to see the color of the product. App is terrible.,1
2020,Very friendly,5
2020,Excellent job keep it up.,5
2020,The application design captures the true reflection of the products offered by ZARA.. fabulous,5
2020,worst app I have used till date.,1

2020,"Worst app ever , its does not update order tracking and delivery takes for ever",1
2020,"Twice i left items in my cart and then got caught up with something so i had to exit the app for about a half hour, when i return my cart is empty! Makes me not want to purchase the items. Considering uninstalling the app. The 3 stars are only for my love of the companies clothing and their production practices.",3
2020,"Honestly, really love this app. Even when im not buying clothes online it is nice to just view the collections zara has to offer.😁",5
2020,Ok,5
2020,Confusing,1
2020,hate it it doesn't have 3/4 country and languages and it is not worth it in the store items are excellent but in this app it isn't so nice.,1
2020,Very happy with the products as well as delivery. Well the packaging is very elegant and the products worth each and every penny. As well as the aesthetic of the app makes the shopping an eye candy. This was my first time buying a Zara product and I must say it's an experience.,5
2020,Amazing speechless,5
2020,The app is not helpful for online shopping at all . Items available in stock are very rare !!!! This is so frustrating.....,1
2020,Stressfull app,1
2020,"Komplikacija za komplikacijom, cak ni podrska ne radi kako treba, ukoliko trebate podrsku, napisete upit, i nista ne pisete u roku od minute, jer naravno, cekate odgovor, aplikacija izbaci poruku da ste dugo neaktivni i da se problem smatra rijesenim. Losa preglednost, greske pri ucitavanju pracenja posiljke",1
2020,"I ordered an item online to pick up in a store- was never notified that it was delivered to the store. Called 10 days after the ""expected delivery date"", took them a few minutes to inform me my package had already arrived. Once I got there, I had to wait again for the employee to find it. It seemed to me that I was not the only unsatisfied customer that had shopped online.",1
2020,"Too bad services. It has been 2 months after you guys notifiy me the refund order has been processed, but I've never my money back until now.",1
2020,Incredible ... But out of budget 😂😂😂,5
2020,The limit on wishlisting items should be removed. Otherwise a great app. Not like other shopping apps which keeps on sending you unwanted notifications.,4
2020,"It is very complex to shop from here as compared to other shopping apps. Moreover, The poses of the models and photo of the dresses they display doesn't show most of the dresses fully... either they show front side only or either side only... dissatisfied... would not recommend.",2
2020,Pooor,1
2020,Please open a store in mangalore Karnataka India.,3

2020,This is good quality product I like this app thanks,5
2020,Does not allow me to make an account. I keep filling in all the details and then it doesn't get saved and without an account I can't even save items and shop for them.,1

2020,Third class,1
2020,Keeps deleting my cart,1
2020,The interface is awful,1
2020,quality is so good,5
2020,"Complicated, even if wants to be simple",1
2020,The app priorities aesthetics over user experience. So much for making the app look beautiful makes navigating around the app very confusing.,3
2020,Very unprofessional and unpleasant experience for me.,1
2020,No money off! No coupons ! No points nothing!!,1
2020,I bought some really good stuff at a discounted price :),5

2020,I got triple debited for a transaction and when querying it with them they tell me to speak to my bank. They refuse to help me. Don't shop on their website or their app. It's not secure,1
2020,"I love Zara, but this app is pain. It's not easy to navigate, and once you are ready to checkout, the items are out of stock. Please fix it and make our shopping experience easier.",3
2020,Good,5
2020,Shipping prices are extremely high almost 300 rupees,4
2020,"App is not user friendly. If you really want to buy zara, better go to some store.",1
2020,"The app itself is well designed and is a nice experience of browsing. The service around purchasing however is terrible. I made a purchase over 2 weeks ago and am still waiting for my order to be dispatched (not even to arrive!!!). The only communication from the retailer was 1 time stating that there will be a delay, with no reason why or formal apology.",1
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Ok,5
2020,Fab clothes but horrible return policy and slow delivery so the 3 stars,3
2020,"if there is even a negative star for the kind of customer service I got from the online shop regarding the mistake they had on delivering totally wrong item to me from what I ordered. they kept of delaying and giving me a vague answer. the order i did is time-sensitive, hence, i made sure it arrives just before I needed it because I planned to give it as a gift. but no, because of them, i am so inconvenienced and the customer service just kept on ignoring me. totally unacceptable!!!",1
2020,Very poor,1

2020,Highly pathetic delivery services... Took a long time for delivering and then too the package is not delivered to me... I ordered the products to gift someone but the delivery services are so poor that it ruined my plan... HIGHLY UNSATISFIED WITH ZARA... But an agent named Priyanka was helpful she assisted me and even she raised a request regarding the revasal of delivery charges...,1

Waste of my time and effort",1
2020,Not recommended at all. Sy pesan lewat Zara Indonesia dan mengajukan refund.. dlm 1 hari barang di pick up tapi sudah 1 bulan lebih refund belum dibayarkan,1
2020,Extremely hard to navigate their website and also their app. I'm not interested in seeing models in artistic poses. I just want to look at the article of clothing. Can't they pose in traditional poses? I'm not interested in seeing close face ups or them upside down. I am a customer and was trying to find a shirt that I liked in store but could not find it. Their website is terrible and hard to navigate and their app is even worse.,1
2020,"Very hard to navigate, very much dislike your new look! 👎",1

2020,I bought a product on 18th june 2020 and raised a return for the same and the product was returned by 22nd june 2020. Today is 24th August 2020 I haven't received my money back it's been more than 2 months and I have called and mailed the customer care 100 of times they say your issue has been escalated but I don't see any action on that. I have lost all my hopes that i will receive my 3k back. Thank you zara for stealing my money.,1
2020,"Placed my order and then paid using UPI, but my order got cancelled showing i have not done my payment and my payment is deducted thus there is no message or no concern of my payment made, balance got deducted , order got cancelled I mean whats going on ?",1
2020,Doesn't let me log in,1

2020,Cannot find anything Weird scroll on the products,1
2020,No women's cologne product on this app,1
2020,Cancelled an order on zara a month ago and still haven't received the refund. The customer service does not even care about sending any confirmation of refund initiation. Worst experience i ever had.,1
2020,You cannot generate returns from the app. You have to log in to Zara's full site on Google to generate your returns for a QR code. I thought the whole point of an app is to make things much easier for the user?,1
2020,Does not remember my log in details and will not send an email to reset password,1
2020,"The application is very easy and quite straight forward with everything, as long as you know what you want you have no issues at all. Love it❤️",5

2020,"Fast, easy, excellent",5
2020,"Horrible, try to get to my recent purchases and only show last years purchases.",1
2020,"It has pathetic customer service . nobody is there to solve your query .I opted for return request ,the came the same day to take away the parcel but taking so long to refund and when asked they just gag out their same crammed sentences so you need to do something about your services and my refund.",3
2020,It is a very bad experience not the app only but the online shopping experience with Zara is a big failiure,2
2020,Sucks Items always out of stock Too many issues,1

2020,Not user friendly,2
2020,I like its brands,5
2020,"I did not find the app (online) experience good. They do not take returns and refunds seriously when you cancel an order. They did not return my money (the amount was huge), even after several complaints. So beware. The customer service is pathetic, you get same system generated replies. Customer is not valued, does not get any help at all.",1
2020,Worst shopping site ever..... They ask for online payment....neither delivered my product nor refunded the money. Don't shop from zara ever,1

2020,😎,5
2020,The worst. I ordered seven items on the app. They never got delivered. The tracker shows when I made the purchase. However they were never sent. I called their customer care line nothing was resolved. Kept being put on hold. I have wasted my time and money on this nonsense. Can't recommend.,1
2020,Payment not proceed,1
2020,Easy to use and they also accept COP. 😊,5
2020,Doesn't work,1
2020,"App lets you save items classified as 'buy later', but you can never erase those items if they become out of stock. :-/ Also, delivery takes at least 2 weeks, with follow up. Home pick up for returns takes almost a moth (with 2 follow ups). So stressful! ☹",1
2020,So expensive,1
2020,Horrible experience. ZARACHAT feature is useless. If there is network issue they will end up the chat own there own without resolving the issue. And again and again new helping desk pops up and asking for whole issue again and again. TOTALLY USELESS.,1

2020,great experienced! however they could have improve their sales. they would out something on sale but they are actually not available.,5
2020,"Things are gone from my shopping bag while i'm shopping ,apparently all the data about available things are not up to date in every moment which is very dissapointing. There should also be some limited amount of time for the things that we put in our shopping bag. If you exit the app, your bag is empy! All in all , not working so well.",2
2020,"Just open my item from Zara's I've been a long time shopper at the many stores they have and have LOVE IT and I've just done online shopping with them excellent service had it delivered to a store of my choice was kept informedon delivery,arrived on time, collected no problem ,well packaged item undamaged ..... well pleased ..

2020,"Troppe poche foto degli item, soprattutto ce ne sono poche in cui gli abiti sono indossati. In più sarebbe utile indicare che taglia indossa la modella per capire meglio la vestibilità.",2
2020,Nice app,5
2020,This app is atrocious!! The layout is the opposite of user friendly. But worse part is that my phone kept restarting every time I tried using it,1
2020,Should make a dark mode for at night so it's easier in the eyes,4
2020,"I legit have to struggle looking for the sale option. The tab position changes so often, also at times discounted articles aren't at all visible.",1

2020,"Confusing, confusing, confusing",2
2020,"I did not face any problems with the App. Everything was easy and smooth. However, I think Zara should really consider training their customer service staff.

2020,Absolutely rubbish customer care. There is a item which got delivered from Zara but my order status shows cancelled. I have contacted Zara 4-5 times on this and everytime I get the answer a team is looking into this. This is just pathetic from Zara support to just change a status from cancelled to delivered. I am not able to return the item as well. Pathetic.,1

2020,Nice,5
2020,Not at all user friendly application. Horrible clothes.,1
2020,Super,5
2020,The app is good enough. A bit different from other ecommerce sites. U would need time to understand. Also the size category needs to me more simpler to be recognizable. Lags a bit in India. Dont know why. I am a one plus 7 user. But overall satisfactory app.,4
2020,Product quality is amazing....,5
2020,Very nice app,5
2020,"Terrible interface. There's no option to sort clothes by price, app is slow and clunky, everytime you go back from a specific product to the main listing it takes forever. Also, the quality and finishing of their clothes have been quite awful lately.",1
2020,great,5
2020,Once you get to know how the app works it's quite simple to navigate.,3

2020,best app,5
2020,Love it,5
2020,"The pages are slow to load, I have had to uninstall and install the app multiple times to get it to work. I only do this because the website it 10x worse than the app. I love shopping at zara but I wish they could fix these glitches.",2
2020,The items in the sale list are always out of stock. App is so frustrating to use. Every time i add a product to my cart it shows available and when i proceed to make purchase the items goes out of stock 😂😂 in matter of minutes. It is so disappointing For a famous and big brand to have such a poorly maintained App. I have literally had most poor shopping experience on this App.,1
2020,Amazing,5
2020,Very fair,5
2020,"This app is terrible. Terrible UX and UI and complicated to navigate. Also has very big pics for no reason like in the desktop version. I've downloaded and uninstalled a couple of times over the years with hopes that would become better, still terrible",2

2020,"It's my type,always new collection n unique and mostly limited.",5
2020,User friendly..,5
2020,"Love zara. Hate the app. Constantly buffering takes a year to load an item. I've stopped shopping online with zara. App is too busy and awful. Also the models look miserable, drawn in the face and far too thin and too tall for me to relate to a single item of clothing. Please get some average size 10 girls who look normal. Outfits are also terrible so put together something realistic?? The outfit combos are so bad it was mentioned on several blogger sites. A smile and a normal pose would do!!",2

2020,So easy to browse and track your packages! Love this App!,5
2020,"Good interface, easy to use.",5
2020,excellent,5
2020,Good collection but items that go out of stock are rarely restocked,4
2020,Really disappointing in this situation where all your hopes are relieing on online shopping and can't visit the store. The product shows available and when the moment you put it in the cart it goes out of stock and the product still shows available over 2weeks. When you actually put the order it does not get delivered instead you get an email that your request for return is accepted where you actually waiting for product to arrive and did not even placed to return request it was really upsetting,1

2020,"Way too expensive clothes with weird designs. The models pose in very weird poses so you can't get a good look at the clothes. Also the models are too skinny, so it's difficult to get an idea about the fitting of clothes. Uninstalled in a few minutes.",1

2020,I made a return request on 18th July but still haven't got any updates on that nor any courier service have contacted me. On the mail it says within 24 to 48 hours courier service will contact you. When i chatted with customer service they say WAIT FOR COURIER SERVICE TO CONTACT U. They have been saying this for 5 days now. WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS ??! Expected more from zara. I want to return some items from my order and i can't do that now because of this.,1

The clothes and everything is visible but the shopping cart says that the product is not available, this Is clearly misleading the customer.

2020,بس ٥٨٦٦ي٩٨,3
2020,The app has a lot of improvements to make when it comes to the chat options. It's not very helpful with resolving issues and they need to do some more testing with keys phrases customer may use to resolve an issue. Also you have to go thru to many windows or clicks to figure out your package status which the app does not do a great job of showing the most updated information. Very disappointing as I have been order and shopping at Zara for years.,2
2020,Easy to browse and makes your shopping experience so fast ...,5
2020,App is not working properly in android please fix dis issue (its getting hang),5
2020,"Such a pathetic app. You can't open so many things together, every time you wanted to add something in your bag the app crashed. And you have to close the app again reopen it.

Will never recommend this app to anyone.. although the cloths are good but in this pandemic situation you can't go out and shop. In the era of online shopping such pathetic online experience makes you irritate.",1
2020,Your Devloper team need to spend some time on Ur App and fix the bug. It doesn't even open the first page forget about shoping. Really disgusting app. I don't even feel like giving any rating. It doesn't even deserve a star but to post this review I have to click on a star.,1
2020,"Seems there's problem after your last release...we found product available while browsing and once we click on cart for payment it's showing ""No longer available"". I have reported this issue since last week but as usual no corrective action from your support desk therefore down grading rating now. Please check my emails and tweets as well. Atleast acknowledge and show some courtesy. You're leading brand of ""Inditex"" and we're not accepting this from you.",1
2020,1.)The size of garment that model is wearing should be mentioned while showing the product. 2.)There another issue that this app doesn't support the UPIM/GPAY/PHONEPE payments even though the payment options are available. 3.) The products which are out of stock are still shown for selection and once you add it in card and go to the cart it shows item is no longer available. 4.) This is one of the biggest issue I've faced that the same product can be seen with two different prices. FIX THESE,1
2020,Doesnot deliver all products,2
2020,Since I have updated app gone slow and takes ages to download a page,2
2020,Excellent stuff love the stuff and material they use ... excellent delivery service and excellent easy return options 👌👍 if you don't like the stuff you jus hv to walk in the store and return it ....counter money return service 👍👌which I like the most and not to worry abt the transfer or giving all my bank account,5

It will only let me browse..cant view my purchases, make return, exchange to name but a few it's even showing returns from a time when I wasnt registered with Zara. What a waste of time & energy. Why not iron out all the creases & eliminate the bugs before torturing (loyal)customers trying to use it. Not a bit happy🧐😠😠😠",1

2020,"Hi, Can someone help me, because the app keeps loading but nothing will happen. After awhile it will say that no product has been found. I've already cleared my chache and data and uninstalled it but it doesn't fix the problem. Thank you.",3
2020,"Alright let me explain to you the nuances of making a return. They will make you fill a return form and you have to go though a long process to return a product. Their customer care is not at a cordial, they never help rectify a problem and you'll be left hanging. This is one of the worst experiences ever. I don't recommend at all",1
2020,Tap took too long to response,1
2020,too insenseable app....not affordable and the most annoying thing is that a simple cloth is also too expensive!!!!!!!...and spreading nudity!!!!,1
2020,Most of the sale items are out of stock 😒,4
2020,This app sucks! Add whatever you want to the cart & then it doesn't allow you to place the f***king order. Wow! Get your mess together zara!,1
2020,"The app works fine and is has had many improvements to its interface and features. You can see your order history with pictures, you have favorites, buy later, the cart doesn't expire quickly. The app has an early sale exclusive and you can see physical store stock with ease. One of the best physical store shopping apps.",5
2020,Sluzi svrsi ☺,4
2020,Spent 50 minutes choosing items! Once at shipping stage it froze! Couldn't go back and couldn't purchase😩,1
2020,Worst app Slow,1
2020,The app has been bugging lately and it's impossible to choose articles in it. There should be an update please.,4
2020,"Worst app ever, its faster to go to the store check the clothes, try them on, buy them, drive back home. This app takes years to load every single time! Worst app ever, awful",1
2020,No estoy en USA!!!!!!!!!!!,1
2020,No reviews/some measures not mentioned at least model lengths/keeps log out/,3
2020,It doesn't open on my phone,1
2020,It works very slow and stops responding in between which is really very annoying,2
2020,Best app,5
2020,Fantastic 👍👍👍,5
2020,It was amazing,5
2020,They don't update the stock as offline store does. Update the app with more items. The interface is not familiar and are not well organised,3
2020,Too costly,2
2020,"Once installed on my phone, why do I have the login every time????",2
2020,App started freezing every 30 secs while browsing.,1
2020,All Functions are not working properly,2
2020,"Love this collection, it's really amazing. Love Zara. Very easy way to shop.",5
2020,I updating the app now but it's not working perfectly?,3
2020,If you wanna look at a blank page with a title instead of looking at clothes then this app is for you!,1
2020,"Easier to use, but most annoying thing I found is, product availability is not updated, as a example, if you're going to sale section, you will find a lot of cloths are on sale! But when you click that specific product you will find that product is not available anymore or coming soon! If that product is not available it's not should be included in sale section.It is so disappointing to find that product is not available or coming soon! Please correct this! At last we don't want to disappoint.",3
2020,Pathetic,1
2020,Best,5
2020,Good,5
2020,Damn good,5
2020,"SHOPPING CANNOT BE TRUSTED ON THIS APP. All of a sudden your purchases go into partial delivery. And you get a mail of product being ""returned"" whereas it was never delivered in the first place. The amount hasn't been refunded either. NO REPLIES AFTER RAISING AN ISSUE.",1
2020,"Confusing interface! There's no simple way to show all items in the main categories (man, woman or kids). You have to use the search feature, but if you're not sure about what you're looking for, perhaps just looking for inspiration(?), you're at a dead end. Horrible really!",2
2020,One of the worst customer services. The online chat disconnects after leaving it because there is no response. The call number does not work at all. The customer care is very ignorant.,1
2020,Just love it n also it has English 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰,5
2020,"The app stopped working.. Only home page is displayed, nothing else would load.. I tried uninstall and install again, updating aswell, zero success..",3

2020,Perfect,5
2020,The chat box is not helpful at all. They turn off the message section anytime they want without even rectifying our problem.,1
2020,It's fabulous,5
2020,"Unable to contact customer service, no update on the order status.",1
2020,Terrible application,1
2020,Very difficult to navigate and to much waste of time to find something. Definitely needs improvement regarding filters and the options of choosing from a multiple selection not through this one by one display of items.,1
2020,The availability of products on sale is just for the show and even when the products are out for the sale none of the sizes are available and everytime it appears that it is unavailable especially the shoes. This app is just to grasp everyone's attention and do nothing.,3
2020,Customer service super bloon. Barang bermasalah saat pengiriman. Mending beli langsung aja ke store.,1
2020,Awesome app,5
2020,I am giving 1star only because your delivery service is very bad. I ordered a jeans for my son 29/06/20. They shipped it on 4/07/20. And after 12days i still don't know where is my order.,1

2020,Half a month it take to solve a small problem they are creepy useless customer care service is the poor ever in the history shame very shame on this people. Hate the service they provide. Zara is a brand name but the quality of some items will never last for a month fed up their customer support team especially the manager they are totally useless idiots better to go to the shop and buy it.,1
2020,Best,5
2020,Worst app. Orders are not being delivered even after 35 days of placing the order. Customer service poeple does not even know about where the order is and there is no escalation even after the customer calls several times. They blame it on Vivid situation but the truth is other orders placed later are being delivered.,1
2020,Bad,1
2020,Very poor service many time i m order same shoes and t shirts but my order is automatically without any call or message cancel very poor poor service,1
2020,VERY BAD APP IM NOT HAPPY THIS ZARA APP,1

2020,"The chat never responds. They deducted money from me but cancelled the order themselves and didn't make any refund whatsoever. They won't respond by any means, be it call, chat , social media. NOTHING. THAT'S SO UNPROFESSIONAL. THIS IS THE WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.",1

2020,There should have been an option of notifying the customer about product size availability. And once the product is added in the cart it shouldn't be sold out to other customers.,3
2020,Very good app I love this app,4

2020,"It's my first time buying online from Zara and I must say it's one of the worst experience I have ever received for an online purchase. Initially they said my order was going to be delivered the 1st week of July. I got a notification that there were delays and my order was going to arrive on the 6th. I still haven't received my order. Honestly not happy with this service. Had I known I would not have ordered online, I would have gone to the store.",1
2020,Fab,5
2020,Superb,4
2020,Very good,5
2020,I didn't used this yet !!😂,5
2020,This was my first order and I am ulternarively happy and satisfied with the order. I would have given it a 5 star for sure but since its was my first.,4
2020,They really don't care about their customers. It's showing in my payment app that the payment has already reached to merchant and the zara app is still showing payment pending and finally it got cancelled. When i spoke with the customer care executive they said we can't do anything it will take 14-15 days for a refund and i am unable to receive the refund now. Never use this app,1
2020,Its great but there should be notifications when the price drops for the items in wishlist and also for when it's reavailable.,5
2020,Many item is out of stock,4
2020,Very fake app. I would suggest every one not to use it. I was entering correct email id and password but still it was showing wrong user id,1
2020,Don't buy anything from this app,1
2020,Had great experience with this app. It's well designed and responsive. However adding a payment method (card) via NFC functionality didn't work for me.,4
2020,Dark mode needed,4
2020,"Customer care number is not working ,not even giving response to chat...suddenly they logout my registration n d problm is i forget my password den I called dem many I suppose to return some products but de r not giving any response, which realy disapointed with out my knowledge how could they logout...ridiculous ...disapointedd",1
2020,good,4
2020,The worst applcation i deal with ever,1
2020,"Best collection for Zara best quality best price, Do you want Jara fashion so one time see really very good collection I like it with best price 👌",5
2020,"Terrible. It wont even let me register bc it doesnt regognise my postal code. I have no idea whats wrong with it, but it irretated me to no end",1
2020,"I love ordering from Zara; all orders are well packaged, arrive super fast and well customer service. The app is available in English even if you're ordering in Turkey and that's what I like the most about it. I recommend for sure and love using this app just for the packaging that I have not seen in other brands.",5
2020,I am facing issue with COD. It automatically cancel my order if i place anything...,1
2020,"App UI is good. When contacted fo help via chat nobody responds at all and I waited there for 4-5mins idle. And they ended the chat. And when called, the person on the other end had no idea and just said one thing as he would escalate this issue to the concerned team and I would be getting a call from supervisor within 24-48 hours and it's.more than 80hrs now.. nobody contacted me and nobody is aware of my order status.. pathetic customer service.!! Juts having good stuff isn't good 😡",1
2020,Zero 🌟. Because: The tracking mechanism in the app doesn't work. Fire your tech guys and hire new one. And your email customer service is also faulty. Gives wrong and self contradictory replies.,1
2020,Thik h,2
2020,"Poor service,worst experience with Zara Online. Not a single proper response from the customer care executives,poor customer care literally pathetic. Such a big brand but they dont care about their customers at all.",1
2020,Not able to track my order,2
2020,Okh,1
2020,Good👍,5
2020,Very artsy but also easy to use,5
2020,Love the ease of use,5
2020,Quite difficult to navigate and you can't see many items of clothing at the one time. I feel like it takes a long time to browse through items so I get fed up quite easily so end up buying very little.,1
2020,My favourite shop,5
2020,Osm app😇,5
2020,Zara immediately need to take steps.There are lot of issues with the app. 1.Sometimes your product dose not get delivered to you. 2.some the items showing out if stock after putting it to the bag. 3. The hepl centre is not at all helpful.,1
2020,The layout and everything and the sorting options are just not upto the mark.. Sometimes it's frustrating.. This app needs a lot of changes,2
2020,"First time shopping on this app - half my orders got cancelled without ANY communication from customer care. I got emails saying ""your return request has been accepted"" when I have NEVER placed any request to return my order. They messed up on their end and are now trying to put the blame on the customer. There's no customer service available either, so now I'm stuck. Please please just rely on Myntra/Amazon/Nykaa etc. instead. This is NOT a reliable app, especially for such expensive products.",1
2020,Really origional products and a great experience of product very god product,5
2020,Not able to cancel orders,3

2020,Perfect details ; clothes are soooo real,5
2020,I was ordered so many clothes it's that good,5
2020,"Great app, but it takes waaay too long for your package to be delivered. Paid quite expensive for the delivery yet they choose the regular one instead of one night services.",3
2020,Is osm,5
2020,But where is cancle order option and items are disappearing very quickly,4
2020,"Chat function is the worst, you are chatting with robots who can never help with anything but an apology. I'm still waiting for an order made on 23 April. Worst shopping app I've ever used.",1
2020,Very bad lately nothing available only coming soon message appear and no emails sent when items restocked,1
2020,Great apps,5
2020,Premium product at an affordable prize,5
2020,Experience is not seamless poor design needs lots of improvement,3
2020,"Horrible experience. After purchasing the items, they delayed the shipment till the time they acknowledged that ""items are out of stock"", i believe they are far from Zara institution in Europe... Make your self a favor visit a shop or you'll just waste your money...",1
2020,they should write the size the model is wearing.,3
2020,Never buy in this app...they never deliver on time and it's been two weeks after.palcing the order am running pillar to pillar to get the product and pathetic support,1
2020,Best app I like it,5
2020,They are always late on deliveries & don't even make it a point to contact you regarding your purchase.,1

2020,Awesome that I use my favorite clothing brand everything is good in this app,5
2020,"Super easy to use, well organized and status of orders are updated and readily available, love this app",5
2020,UI is brilliant,4
2020,There's no way you can get an update of your order status and moreover they don't reply. Edit: the only app withh fast delivery during this pandemic😀,5
2020,Can you pls upgrade your shoe size up to a sz 12 n women,5
2020,Not user friendly,1
2020,Waste of time,1
2020,V.nice,1
2020,"This app is good , awesome ..but at the same time there are difficulties to get the money back. So I would rather request you and your store to please respond as fast as you guys could overcome this problem.",3
2020,Quite convenient to use,5
2020,Many options are missing in the app.,2
2020,"The app was glitchy and confusing, the website is much easier to use then the app.",1
2020,Osmm🔥🌈,5
2020,"Cuidado, envia o preço quando é presente.",1
2020,Very useful and easy to order.,5

2020,i ordered 3 shirts 11 days ago n it hasnt arrived yet.. nobody is replying to my email and nobody answering the call in stores.. theres no update on my order on the app.. not even yet ready to send.. it still says preparing!!! horrible experience,2
2020,good,4
2020,Very very very bad.. Unsatisfied with the online services provided by Zara from 19 june 2020 i have ordered and today is 30 june not yet received and the expected delivery date was on 24 june 2020 the status is showing being prepared until when???,1
2020,"Don't know if it's the app, or the order department but my orders keep getting cancelled. It's annoying, so much for having an app for easier shopping..",1
2020,Delivery experience was ridiculous. The costumer support is damn slow to act upon issues caused to costumer. I regret choosing zara online. Worst service.,1
2020,Not deliver my parcel,1
2020,Fantastic,5
2020,Awesome,5
2020,"The Zara chat feature is horrible. There is no form of accountability but just preprogrammed bot responses that don't address your questions or problems. Further on the app merges orders from two completely different dates and this prevents you from cancelling a specific order and you end up with things you don't want. My conclusion is that Zarachat isn't helpful, Zara needs a direct line where I can resolve issues that I know can be easily resolved via a phone call with a person.",1
2020,Worst experience.. they will never deliver your product ..and keep your money for weeks .. don't buy online with them,1
2020,It is having very few varieties of clothes,1
2020,"Kindly provide parcel current location in your tracking system, also provide AWB no. So that customer can easily trace the parcel status. Otherwise everything is nice till today. Best of luck Zara team.",5
2020,"Hey you guys, I've purchased a skinny joggers first of all it was not 1/4th of what it seemed in the picture like colour wise. And after when I got it, the quality seem good at First but shortly after the threads started to come off, had enormous expectations but it turns out these top-end brands are not all good. Probably my first and last item from this 'outlet'.",1
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Its good collection mashallah,5
2020,This app is really awesome... It's one of the best application which I have come across....,5
2020,Very nice,5
2020,Very good company,5
2020,I don't get any update on goods purchased. The app does not show where is your parcel or whether it is in tramsit or stuck somewhere. Also the customer service is so disgusting and disrespect they don't correct any information after placing order and ask you to purchase something else,2
2020,Order is constantly being canceled,1
2020,👍,3
2020,Thank you so much,5
2020,Just can't have enough of ur products.🙌 Love Zara,5
2020,"I purchased few item n quality was not up to the mark its look like fake products n not even first copy very cheap product n send them mail and they didn't even respond n requeste for return through home collection they already took product back but after that i didn't get any updates regarding refund i emailed them.twice but same thing happened , very slow service i am not happy with the productd",1
2020,Excellent 👍,5
2020,"Usually ships super fast. Have only had 1 shipping issue so far. Wish they had plus sizes, but I get cute accessories and the sales are pretty awesome.",3
2020,Excellent app,5
2020,Store availability can be better,3
2020,Love the ease if accessing the app,5
2020,Good,5
2020,This app sucks!,1
2020,"What'a the point of this app if all the sizes of all the items are marked ""coming soon""??",1
2020,It's very good,5
2020,Customer servicenya lousy worst ever! Di email jawabannya dicopy paste doang dan ga dijawab samasekali pertanyaannya. How can zara trained customer service as stupid as pig? and no respect at all.. i emailed 3 times and what i got was responsed just like robot without giving me answer. just copy paste and repeating the same answered. didnt even answered what i was asking. at the end just put no respect to me and saying the same stupid things without really put on concern of what im asking!!,1
2020,User interface is not good at all. Payment gets stuck,1
2020,Para devolution un mes quando Lanca pedido si te llega 2semana Tiene 2 semana para cambiar,1
2020,Nice,5
2020,"Easy and efficient app. Great that I can use it in English in Korea unlike other retailers like H&M. The app is so easy to use with payment apps like Payco. And has cute functions like saving the order confirmation as picture in your gallery. Best of all is the easy return process! Unlike other retailers (yes, H&M, I'm referring to you again) Good job Zara!",5
2020,"Tried to chat with the CS, and everytime, the chat was onesidedly closed with the caption ""we detected you've been inactive for a while"" Meanwhile i was writing the mssg. That's super confusing.",1
2020,Really like the app and company policy.,5
2020,Rubbish,1
2020,The app works fine but Zara online shopping is a nightmare. It took them a week to debit my account for my purchases then 3 weeks to receive my order. And then I submitted the return form which has no option for exchange items and I sent them a chat no feedback email has an automated response it's terrible shopping on the app I must day,2
2020,"The experience is very pleasent with the app so far though you need sometime to get used to it but the app is very organized and elegant. There is just two things I'd like to suggest for a change. 1. Please bring an option to cancel orders, there isn't any by chance if we want to cancel it we have to wait for it to arrive and deny delivery or return and ask refund both are a hassle. 2. The size chart needs to be less cluttered and please add inseame for trousers, joggers and jeans.",4
2020,It's totally waste and these guys are rejecting the order and if I'm asking the customer service they're not responding well,1
2020,Very poor,1
2020,"I love the app. The only thing is availability of what you like in your size, especially bigger sizes.",4
2020,This is a wonderful app,5
2020,Good product . I also impressed thos products . Tq,5
2020,Verry good ahoping,4
2020,The app is horrible. Not user friendly at all. The chat function sucks. You are basically talking to robots. Don't purchase on the app because you have to accept terms. The terms WILL share your information so use the app only for a shopping guide. The help desk doesn't help because they cannot even tell you how to view your card information. Just don't.,1
2020,Store Availability is not accurate. Purchase through app is the worst experience! No coordination with customer esp when delivering with the item. Nice goods but service is Not recommended!,2
2020,"Paying the extra amount to receive the orders faster is as slow as the default way. And on top of this, zara won't give you the money back for choosing the fast delivery method so if you're in a rush to get something from Zara, go buy it in the store. A bit disappointing...",2
2020,No option to query orders!!! Left stranded,2
2020,"Whoever designed Zara's website and app did an amazing job. I don't think any shopping app's interface compares. Super user-friendly, always a seamless experience. Whoever quality controlled this product did an amazing job. The weird things I notice lol!",5
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Best,5
2020,its not a accurate it's not helpful don't offer much help for the sizes option to be change some of your clothes size fit smaller,3
2020,Very poor app needs to be upgraded,2
2020,Boom,5
2020,My miss ANAND isme shopping Karti hai isliye Kar RHI hu,4
2020,👎,1
2020,No me dejó entrar a mi cuenta ni tratando de cambiar la contraseña... de regreso al navegador.,1
2020,I think items should have a wait time when you place them in your cart,1
2020,I am giving this app due to pricing and difficulty of the shopping experience. You can not Google the name Zara clothing just to see items you physically have to get the app which i think its stupid unless you like this store overall. I believe your prices are a bit over priced but hey I get it I work in retail myself so I know ok.. I understand what people think about this store with low ratings. Perhaps read their suggestions and make your app a little bit easier to use please.,1
2020,Worst models. They make the clothes look bad.,1
2020,Most off the items are not available then why they are on the app just put the available ones plz,1
2020,Does not ship to Nigeria,1
2020,Easy to use,5
2020,Love this app,5
2020,Best way to shop,5
2020,You always have no sizes from almost all of the products on the app.. when u announce a sale we go check but also no sizes! So why to have this app since i can't buy through it!!,1
2020,"Great user experience - kudos to the designers, project managers, and developers.",5
2020,Good,5
2020,"Is not intuitive or user friendly, doesn't allow you to add bank card details or status updates are completely irrelevant and really doesn't hold Zara accountable for a great customer experience. You are not able to rely on any status update or lack thereof. There is no flow or checkout basket that makes sense and the delivery date is vague to say the least. From time you order it tells you that delivery date is anything from 5 days after the order to an additional 7 days is when you may get it",1
2020,Being a such big brand.. I expect the app to be user friendly.. It's quite inconvenience to use compare to other app.,1
2020,I love it,5
2020,"Gets locked or program shuts itself often...when will you fix this problem I wonder... Such a pity my shopping gets blocked each time, still persistently I buy but this is so unfair and irritating for your users, one might easily give up and delete the app and not buy.. It's like you are testing us, so annoying shopping experience... 😔",2
2020,Love it!!!,5
2020,"Great App but giving 4 stars instead of 5, because of the shopping experience. The items were disappearing constantly from my basket, as soon as they were put in. Please can you allow time for people to browse, before they pay, so its a more enjoyable less stressful experience, and gives everyone a chance to purchase what they want. 😊 Thanks",4
2020,"App is great in terms of its presentation and userfriendly nature, the quality of images and overall UI is really good. I just had one issue with it though , track your delivery link doesn't work from placed order section, you might wanna look into it.",4
2020,Great app,5
2020,Absolutely wonderful app. Totally in love with the simplistic design.,5
2020,Amazing♡♡☆☆☆,5
2020,Payment didn't go through. Although I checked with the bank and they didn't receive any transaction from zara. Tried several times. In addition to this no one answered the email or calls or chat .,1
2020,"I ordered an item over a month ago (its going to be almost 3 months now) I've ordered through this app before, no trouble at all and got here in 2 weeks. Now my item says it's been collected by the courier, it just needs to be delivered. I just want to know when it'll get here and I don't want to keep waiting so I might refund.",1
2020,All time best shopping store,5
2020,Can't track the delivery through app.,3
2020,"I had ordered Zara seoul summer perfume in March 2020. However i received the regular Zara Seoul. So i requested for exchange, the perfume was sent back to them and its been more than three months no come back or update Zara. Customer service always ask me to wait. Never buy from Zara again. Its been 3 months now Zara has not replaced my product to me nor they are giving my money back.",1
2020,Excellent experience 👌 highly recommended.,5
2020,"The app isn't good , after I checkout it won't authenticate my payment",1
2020,The app is good with large variety. I am facing an issue with the payment from a few months. I tried with many cards from different banks but of no use. Hope you rectify it soon or provide us with other alternatives. Waiting so badly to order some clothes for my little one. Even though I like many items I am just backing out because of the payment.,2
2020,The information in app Not match with stores,1

2020,Great and easy to use,5
2020,Amazing,5
2020,AMAZING!!@@,5
2020,"The app is not user friendly, and sometimes stock will show as available at certain stores on the app, but in store they won't have stock. I've been in an actual store checking my app and the store at the same time. Chatline via the app is not helpful either",1
2020,Is very interesting,5
2020,"Terrible app, along with a terrible website. The awful system of entering addresses meant my order was sent to wrong address and Zara will not do anything about it. Will not shop with Zara online or via this app again",1
2020,App stops working during browsing? Then goes back to beginning very annoying. Always seem to have trouble given up looking online at Zara !,2
2020,Very bad experience Lost shipment since 25 days,1
2020,"Can't make purchases from it every time the order gets cancelled, there is no FAQ , and customer services never answer when contacted from the contact information.",1
2020,I love it,5
2020,Love this app! So easy to shop!,5
2020,Great shooping experience,5
2020,Needs improvement in various functionality,3
2020,Great app with beautiful collection,5
2020,This app makes a great purchase ❤️❤️,5
2020,"Service client indisponible, j'arrive pas à annuler des commandes depuis 24hrs Je recommande pas",1
2020,The mobile app is really a pain when it comes to the customer care/help section. The chat automatically disables after every 5-10 seconds even when you're typing. The bug needs to be fixed. The check in availability feature seems to be disabled almost all the time. there's no way you can access multiple options for a particular product item. UI is fancy but the UX part just sucks.,2
2020,Worst app ever. You can type while registering yourself.,1
2020,"Zara shopping is a NIGHTMARE. App crashes and lags most of the time. Customer service is terrible. Shipping is worst, as well as delivery because not one order ever reached me.",1
2020,"Customer service is extremely bad. Delivery takes up to one month to recover. No one to speak with and if you're lucky to chat with someone, they dont have any answers.",1
2020,Good experience but most of the product are at MRP no discount so buying the product on Zara is pretty expensive.,4
2020,Easy to use,5
2020,Not user friendly,1
2020,"Just use the website.. it always lags, barely ever works properly... more of just a headache than anything else.",1
2020,All are coming soon,1
2020,So confusing and not easy to work with.,1
2020,I am looking for perfumes but I cant get them on the app.😭,1
2020,Nice app👍,4
2020,Very nice app and very usefull,5
2020,Zara have disgraceful customer service. Staff dont give a sh** and orders dont arrive and takes months to force them to give your money back. Never buy online with these crooks,1
2020,They are a liar about delivered day,1
2020,"When I click register, it doesnt allow me to input details even though i clicked on the field already.",1
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Excellent,5
2020,Its a ZARA experience.,5

2020,Better experience,5
2020,Awesome,5
2020,I don't understand just after a week delivery received. I tried ordering again & it says my location is not eligible for delivering despite the fact that all other online stores are delivering their merchandise here. It's a shame man.,1
2020,Nice,5
2020,Precise and clear information about products.,5
2020,There are very helpful I didn't receive my order they sorted the problem out for me in three days,5
2020,"It is a nightmare after each update. I decided to update it even though the previous verson was working ok(ish), the only issue I had was the occasional random crashes. This updated version crashes constantly, wont let me log in and texts disappear. So it lacks performance but content is quite goodand easy to navigate around.",1
2020,Be arlday thank you so much,5
2020,"The app itself is very good, responsive, mobile friendly etc. What is not good at all is the customer service which doesnt respond fast + their answers are not helpful at all",1
2020,"Loads a white screen, can't do anything else, then have to kill the app to quit.",1
2020,Good,5
2020,App ok but delivery time very very poor,3
2020,Nice Collection my favourite brand only zara,5
2020,I order an order from 3rd May and up till now didnt recieve it and also no customer service availability which can help No email and the chat option with no reply,1
2020,Its a dreadful app. Poorly thought out. Difficult to navigate and just too much hassle to use,2
2020,No idea,1
2020,Very poor. Turkey is not among country selection in address page.,1
2020,Excellent,5
2020,Too slow and laggy,1
2020,SUPERB AAAAA +++++,5
2020,"Reviw for Zara INDONESIA: The app is responsive, although lacks for sorting feature (only filters). BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS: Zara not only delays shipping of otherwise short trip (Jakarta to any Javanese cities won't take >3 days), but also CHOOSES the slowest, clumsiest and most unreliable shipping partner: JNE. It's just exacerbating the problem, first you took one week to prepare the order, and one MORE week to let JNE deliver the otherwise 2-day worth of shipping!! Choose other expeditions.",2
2020,"Really straight forward easy and quick app. Whatever problems people were having before it appears to be fixed. I've use during a flash sale, it didn't crash or slowed down. And I can finally save my favourite item and wait until it goes on sale!!",5
2020,Not a great use experience - lots of bugs in simple things such as tracking delivery. Not useful for a user,2
2020,Horrible to navigate,1
2020,I can't delete my old address and you keep sending me to that old address.,2

2020,Great shopping I've ever had in my hand,5
2020,I love ZARA but .. while paying a big amount on debit card and UPI it declines payment most of the time. Make sure you work on it. Rest is fine. Live for the app. Have had faced no issues with their items so far! A happy client! Also please introduce paytm for fast payment.,3
2020,It's not working,1
2020,Amazing app.,5
2020,"I ordered a parcel from zara a few days back and I didn't receive my order until I recieved a message of my order getting cancelled, without me providing cancellation code.when I called the delivery partners, they claimed receiving no update from merchant.When I called zara, they blamed it on system malfunction.and this is not the first time.they do it often, blame it on system or merchant or others.this is customer harassment,to keep calling and not getting proper assistance from zara.",1

2020,"Love shopping with Zara, great online experience and delivery. Clothes fit great and quality is fab.",5
2020,So poor that it has made me not to want to order anything else online. The returns service is so bad that one star is too much. I have a post office two minutes walk away however the service has decided that it would be better for me to go miles down the road and drop off somewhere else. They have stated that it couldn't be changed and that I could wait until the shops open again. Making online service pointless if I an going to have to go to shop anyway,1
2020,I want to chance size no one reply me,1
2020,"Hard to navigate, only shows new collections. Cannot find the option of items such as trousers, tops, accessories as you can on the web page. Deleted the app and just using the web page now.",2

2020,Worst app ever,1
2020,"Since you register, you can't change address of your account, when you buy something, need to check constantly are you order to correct address, as I use to live in other side of England, so constantly ordering to old address, gives a headache all the timr",2

2020,"If you have saved an old address in the app, there s no way for you to change it. There s no option available in this app, the communication on chat is shameless, the agents don t reply, the conversation will end automatically if you haven't been active more than 1 min. I strongly do not recommend. Use the shops or make sure all your contact infos are correct otherwise you ll get a heart attack.",1

2020,"Parabéns Zara, até ano passado conseguia usar o aplicativo sem problema, agora não consigo nem procurar uma calça porque a navegação tá um porre",2
2020,I couldn't give a single star. The worst ever service and quality of my slides. Quality of the slides are worst and the slides were not used for one month also. I don't why they sell the waste quality products. They don't have return policy on their products . It's a shame on zara. I request the people here not to buy the products.,1
2020,"I actually want to rate the service! My shoes were delivered in less than 24 hrs. Ordered yesterday afternoon and by 9:30am, they were on my feet! Love that!",5
2020,people becarfull from ordering online. it's not allowed to exchange and refund a money . I got my online order and went to the store to exchange one piece my size only ...they refused. they said it's not allowed now . it's government law.

2020,"Love zara app ,very easy to use Well categorized I shop a lot for my kids and I love the kids section ,pictures are very clear and description for the product is really helpful plus I like the matching suggestion the app shows under every product you choose 😊",5

Am rămas cu banii dați și atât... Pe scurt hoție... Disappointing ... My money was taken from the card and the order was not fulfilled. There is no phone number for support, I sent an email more than 3 days ago to which I was not answered. I was left with the money given and that's it ... In short, thief .",1
2020,Excellent interface.,5
2020,I have done payment already which the amount has been deducted from my account alread in UPI but zara showed payment pending when i try to connect with the costumer care nothing was done but new people connect everytime i message with no intention to help ... They finally cancel my order saying payment not made but the amount has been deducted already. I'm really disappointed with online experience and my money isnot refunded yet.,1
2020,Difficult to use. Tried to filter but keeps covering set menu with views for those.,2
2020,It's okay but randomly will empty your basket even though you're logged in. That's frustrating. Also sometimes the photos of the items in your basket are wrong - but looks as if it's pulling in the wrong image after you've put it into your basket. Also makes things a bit tricky. Good points - nice to be able to see everything in the app.,3
2020,Didn't receive my one month ago order!,1
2020,It is a very nice app,5

2020,I've returned some items and it has been over one month and they have not returned my money and they are impossible to reach.,1
2020,"Can't collect points from your purchases, doesn't have any real use unless you're shopping online. I don't, I like to go in the store; but I will say the app is very well put together so if anything its nice to look at.",2
2020,Chat keeps freezing.,1
2020,Amazing,5

2020,Easy to use. It wud help if it told us how many items they have left in stock. It helps with the decision making. It workas wondera on other shopping apps,5

2020,"Love, love the Zara Designer App. Fun and user friendly! Best I've seen!!!",5
2020,Edit function is gone.. i cannot delete options,3
2020,i just use it 5minute then i wan to uninstall it.,1
2020,"New update sucks and obviously untested. The UI in the cart does not present a way of editing or deleting items, just the buy now button. After spending WAY too much time chatting with two support staff due to chat breaking the first time I realized they had no idea what the problem might be and it was clear from my exp and other reviews the new release was untested across all devices and is a bad release they should be informing chat staff of issues.",1

2020,They okay just a bit high for no reason,3
2020,"It has all of my favourite clothes, just as in the store, i ordered some.",5
2020,Zara has always been specifically my favorite app For online shopping and marchandising this not only give me immense list of products to go through but also aware me about the latest fashion trends globally This makes me fell more deprived towards the app furture and it's fashion scene categorising fashion on the basis of gender and looks is a great step towards fashion forecast.,5

So I am now signed up now to see what happens next. Good luck to all. Hang in there. The clothing is worth it.",2
2020,Zara is one of my favorite store to shop. Since I don't get around to go to the store physically; I shop online when I can. I do browse 3-4 times a day.

2020,Love it,5
2020,It is very nice and I love it so ooooo much,5
2020,First of all the app does not offer the option of selecting a region of Bosnia and Herzegovina which has its own language and it is a separate country yet when you choose the region of some other country you can select the Bosnia but only in Croatian which is another country and the language spoken there and English so once you select one of those it just crashes and then you have nothing so even though no that's quite good business in Bosnia it seems they only speak one language.,1

2020,Worst online shopping experience I have ever had and terrible customer service! Every order I had placed was either very delayed or cancelled as a result of stock running out after I had already paid for the item! I have been waiting for a refund of over R1000 for over a month now and have no hope that I will ever get it because customer service is so unresponsiveness.,1

2020,"You broke the intuitive experience for the user. I don't have a list anymore, so I can not see all the skirts or all the dresses. This is a total mess, please check with you designers how it should be done. This is a awful experience",1
2020,"Not functional, no search option",1
2020,"Great retailer. App is good now, too.",5
2020,The save for later list can't be edited & it would be so much easier to be able to shuffle items if you could delete the items which are nolonger available. Also running low in stock needs to be highlighted as the love chat is appalling. No help at all.,1
2020,It's very difficult to shop with this app. Always stopping. It's really really frustrating. Please work on it.,1
2020,We'll see,2
2020,"Zara's quality, style, customer service is great.",5
2020,The site is not up to date,5
2020,"Been trying for hours to place an order and finally quit! Had to go back to browsing like a million times, because once you get to your shopping bag, surprise surprise, half of the items are out of stock. Really annoyed by the fact that the stock is not updated, lots of items still appear in the app, although there is no available size. All in all, it makes the shopping experience really really bad and stressful.",1
2020,"Very poor experience, I wanted to purchase an item on sale and intead of telling me that its out of stock, it just refuses to load into the cart..... Learn from the likes of superbalist their app is increadible!",1

2020,"Chat is completely useless! Constantly no replies when using it, then within less than a minute the chats are automatically closed for 'inactivity'. When you are chatting to someone they can't access the last chat?? So you have to repeat yourself 100x Also staff promising email updates and this doesn't happen. Pretty poor for such a huge company!",1

2020,Like how they match the outfit for you according to what you like and how you like it with your sizes. Feeling as if you went to a Taylor for clothing as in my grandma's generation.,4
2020,Not happy. I bought a few things last year on 12/26/19 and I weren't delivered yet. I contacted Zara a few times and they said they going to check and then I will have a confirmation. I'm still waiting for them,2
2020,"Unorganized ,Bad and I was disappointed that after I paid the money online for two items .I recieved only one .after 5 days of paying the money for both. They sent an email today for not having the other item without even confirming when they will give me my money back .",1

2020,"It appeared to be useless, since it shuts down unexpectedly and forgets all the things from a basket. I have tried four or five times... going back to my computer to order everything there. Bye, app.",2
2020,No user friendly at all. Difficult or impossible to find what are you looking for.,1
2020,The contact information provided is not useful,1
2020,"Searching engine too strict... I like to see things for kids or on sale (for ex) in general not only shoes, or pants. Since it's an app it would be great if alert you about sales.",1
2020,"Quite confusing app to use in the beginning. There's no favourite button while browsing all items,only when you see each item separately. Limited filters, like no sorting out by price or any other kind what so ever. The filters don't work properly. For example filtering the items by size will resort into seeing items that do not exist in the preferable size.",3
2020,App not working,1
2020,Very good.,5

2020,Gud,5
2020,WORST SHOPPING APP BY FAR. THEY HAVE ALL THE ITEMS POSTED ON THE APP AND ONCE ADDED TO THE CART ALL ITEMS ARE OUT OF STOCK. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THEY DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO LET YOU KNOW ON HOW MANY ITEM THEY HAVE ON STOCK OR WHAT. WASTE OF TIME.,1

2019,"Yeah , everything is absolutely great but tgere is no option for kids it would be more nice if tgey add kids section too.",4

2019,Great experience,5
2019,Nice,5
2019,👎,1
2019,"Crashes Often!!!! And...you have to scroll images vertically instead of horizontally. One accidental swipe diagonally shoots across to the next item. Stock doesn't update in real time. You can select an item and go to checkout, only to find it's out of stock. This can seemingly take hours to update.",1
2019,I love this app,5
2019,"Inspite of using my proper email address and password ,there is constant demand for resetting passwords .Makes the use of account cumbersome and impossible .",1

2019,Nice,4
2019,Worst experience. This app doesn't let me add my account details for refund. Therefore my refund is stuck for last one month.,1
2019,"Frustrated. Where are the returns listed? Where to see the return labels to show to the store clerk? Why making return so complicated: show the return label is not good enuf, we must show the invoice also. Yet, the store wifi is terrible!",1
2019,Awful,1
2019,Zara app is so weird and co fusing its better to go on the website and check,1
2019,Can not find store,1
2019,Many products are not available in Hyderabad (India).It might be the best app if all the products available in India. Thankyou.,3
2019,If I could apply zero I would. Terrible 24 hrs chat facility that is not fit for purpose! Definitely communicating with robots and not not sophisticated robots at all.,1
2019,Love Zara always,5
2019,Not good After spending quite some time on line shopping for just the right items I got to the end and that's when all the drama started. I tried to check out and pay but the app would not allow me to get past the personal information portion. It kept knocking me out saying that my address was wrong or was not valid.,2
2019,I don't like it.,1
2019,Good quality,5
2019,UI is very poor. It should be simpler,1
2019,Lovely app,5

2019,Purchased a perfume and received an empty bottle.E-mailed customer care service several times and got no reply....i will def stop shopping from Zara online.,1
2019,Nice Collection,5
2019,Too much bugs and errors I can't stand it.,1
2019,"My god, this app is a nightmare to use. The website is already bad enough so I thought this would be better. They've sacrificed a streamlined browsing experience in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing, not a good choice in my opinion.",1
2019,Installed the app and all I see is a white screen.,1
2019,Impressive app,5

2019,"I authorized a payment when I was making my purchase and boom today another payment goes off my bank account and mind you I have not even received the goods but have paid twice already. My bank cannot just reverse the payment because the dates differ... Such an inconvenience, your'll need to work on this ASAP",1
2019,How to get discount coupons here,5
2019,It doesn't use my place it keeps giving me a location in the US!!,3
2019,"their courier service is legit trash, the packaging is damaged, dirty and takes forever to deliver 🙄",1
2019,"I love the shopping experience but when it comes to chat.. Well you have a claim, you send it and if you just change screens while you wait For the answer your claim is considered solved. So if you have a claim you have to stay on the specific Page, dont dare to even look in the same app for your order number. Never had this chatting experience before. I am using it in Greece",3
2019,Find it really tedious to use why cant it just be simple I've been looking for girls clothes for days,1
2019,Exelant product Good paking and good service,5

The chat 24/7 NO One on the other side replies and then, they close my window for ""inactivity"" no one giving me an answer when I've made an order 9 days ago, and stl haven't received it and no one replies.... I love the clothes on zara, but this service is really bad. It's gonna be 15 days and still waiting for my package to arrive.... I've paid 100£ and customer service is USELESS! No one gives me a proper answer, honestly TERRIBLE SERVICE!",1
2019,I'm so mad I don't even wanna comment on this.,2
2019,The app is slow. Not user friendly interface.,1
2019,Great app,5
2019,Nice,4
2019,Way too slow,2
2019,"The worst experience in my life. This app doesn't even allow to create an account properly. Neither does allow to add the product in cart. And when contacting the customer executive through their chat, they have their own way of blaming it back to the customer.",1
2019,"Very slow working , without good info 👎",1
2019,"The app is awesome but I truly believe Zara will benefit from incorporating following: a) input an area where customers can save items for purchasing later. b) establish a Zara Closet which would be an assist to many Zara customers like my self. c) I want to be a ZARA model, I have the ""look"" for the styles in real time.",5
2019,There is no customer support from zara . Very long delivery times.,2
2019,Downloaded the application and its been 25 minutes am not getting the main home page... Uninstalling now 👍🏻,1
2019,Wonderful parfomench,5
2019,The delivery is never on time.,3
2019,Love this store everything fits perfect.,5
2019,It should include similar items.. It should also accommodate sliding over to the next picture of the product when it is clicked upon to zoom... Make a better UX.,2
2019,I love it,5
2019,"Excelent app ever , I love it",5
2019,Superb,5

2019,Honestly I find it fun to shop on Zara on their website because it really just has everything and anything from clothes to home items to jewellery,5
2019,Best clothing & great deals,5
2019,Nycc,5
2019,Nice quality products + Fast delivery,5
2019,"I love Zara clothes but I HATE this app! The layout is really fiddly, I don't love how the clothes are presented on a lot of models. ASOS makes moving around the app and finding things so easy, they have runway videos so you can see the item in real time, and there are so many category options. I get really overwhelmed using this app and it's a shame, I hope they simplify the layout and give more category options soon 😣",1
2019,Very bad,1
2019,マイリストのアイテムは全然キープしてない👎,1
2019,App crashes when starting..,1
2019,mostly ok but sticks alot on the scanning section,3
2019,great app,5
2019,Garbage app from a garbage company,1
2019,"Nothing is perfect. Of course, there are a few minor flaws but I still find this app is great in many ways. Compared to other shopping apps (from big brand names), this app works way better than those so that I can finish transactions in the app without feeling need of opening a web browser.",5
2019,This app should leave a room for individual item reviews. This would help customers make the right choices when buying items and reduce the number of returns.,3
2019,Good,5
2019,Worst experience ever. Never recieved my parcel nor a refund.,1
2019,Super slow!,1
2019,"No option to choose India under region. Hence can't see relevant collections. This is elementary folks, you have stores here, you should have this region as an option.",1
2019,nice super,5
2019,why always asking permission for track order...while open the app every time?!,1
2019,Very bad application... And service... You make an order and get a confirmation letter... Then when ask where is the order.. Surprisingly .. they inform you.. Maybe it's out of stock or something wrong happened to that item.. without even inform you of that.,1
2019,The log in system is old-fashioned,1
2019,Zara is so expensive but I like it because the quality is equal with the price,2
2019,i like this app and zara,4
2019,Amazing style stunning combinations ....just love it ❤👍,5
2019,Nic,5
2019,Taking long to open an item,4
2019,Amazing App Fully satisfied!!,5
2019,Great,5
2019,Good,5
2019,The worst customer service. Sent wrong item and I had to go to hustle proces to return something I didn't order. And now the don't have what I order in first place.,1
2019,Why have you deactivated the store location option 😣,1
2019,Good,5
2019,Nice,4
2019,Amazing,5
2019,The worst delivery ever I dont recommend it to any one. They promised to deliver by Wednesday and I received the items on Friday while I am out of the country,1
2019,Dont save the items I put in the cart as soon as I close the app,1
2019,Your black friday sucks first u said it will start midnight and the app was under construction and eventually 40% on selected item dont call it black friday next time please,1
2019,"It's very complicated to delete an item from your shopping cart.. A bit of dark patterns here. Also, no matter how hard I looked for, I couldn't find th option to receive the order in a physical store.. So, overall a crappy experience..",2
2019,Great,5
2019,"Went on the app on black Friday, could not purchase ONE THING because it kept crashing.",1
2019,Unable to open the site,1
2019,Good Quality,5
2019,"I wished that once I proceed with the payment to have those items reserved, not at the last step to be told that the items are out of stock. This is extremely disrespectful to the customer, I am not gonna spend 1h trying to buy something, so I gave up. I m deleting this app.",1
2019,Whyyyy have you deactivated the one thing that helps in locating a product in stores? Then offering complete and utter confusion on the said item being in stock then not. No opportunity to be notified if item comes in. I did have the item saved since this morning and not only is it totally gone but I can't even resave it. Deleting it and uploading again didn't make this app any better. Annoyed me so yup gonna delete.,1
2019,Won't let me change password,1
2019,"At last! A well-designed, stylish and functional app that actually does what I want it to do. The Zara app makes shopping through an app a pleasure. It looks good, for a start. Everything works as it should and browsing items and placing an order is a breeze... once you place an order the app asks if you'd like it to take a screenshot of your confirmation. I've never had an app ask this before - and as it's something I would normally do myself, I think it's a really useful feature!",5

2019,Not good,1
2019,Bakwas,1
2019,"So Serbia has an active on line store, but when you download the app, or go to a website and try to add a gift card to a wallet, which is an option available for all other countires, you cant!!! Which means that a gift card you get in the store, that you spend money for, has to be used in the store, which usaually arent stocked and you cant find items you want in them, so you have to spend your money again on purchssing online!!! This is such a scam!!!",1
2019,The app is not opening only white screen appears,1
2019,I like the coworkers are so nice and i love the clothes !!,5
2019,First time to use so can't make much of a comment yet.,4

2019,Very bad experience. No customers services representative,1
2019,Find the app hard to navigate. Not enough filter options.,1
2019,Good quality and affordable prices,5
2019,Every time I try to register an account on this app but it doesn't work it doesn't accept my phone number. Gosh how stupid,1
2019,"Terrible!, freezes too often. Tried to setup to be notified when an item would be available. Couldn't do it therefore I will not know if it comes back in stock. Fix it please!",1

2019,The Best app ZARA,5
2019,Great,5
2019,"If I could give this app and Zara Customer service a 0 I would. I purchased from Zara ""online"" for the first time, with it even giving me a selection of dates & stores to choose for pickup. Yes it says ""estimated delivery date"", but in my experience that means maybe 1-2 days late. Not only did it not arrive 2 days later, but when I tried to ""chat"" with the helpline and ask if this is common, all they did was say ""sorry"" and not even address my question. Will never purchase again",1

2019,Unique collection and mind blowing perfume,5
2019,Good experience,5
2019,"The design is nice and user friendly. But, I almost never get to the end of a list of items by scrolling, because the app crashes. Also, there are crashes when I try to get to certain pages & the loading tiiiiime is verrrrrry loooong.",2
2019,Best app .soo easy to shopping and fast delivery,5
2019,"I love that there is a ""buy later"" option. What you do is add all of your favorite items in your cart (do this online, signed in to your account) and then open the app and go to the cart. Select ""edit"" and then tap all the things you want to buy later. I don't know if there is any easier way, but that's what I did. Essentially, you're creating a ""wishlist"" or a list with items you like. Hope this helps! 😁",4
2019,Nyccccc app,5
2019,App keeps crashing,1
2019,No está México en opciones para crear una cuenta.,1
2019,Best app for shopping . Quality of clothes and shoes are awesome nd perfect,5
2019,"Very poor delivery company #aramex I ordered since 30 of October but didn't receive my order till now. They also want to deliver in their suitable time regardless if it is suitable for me or not. Will not recommend to use it for anyone. You pay and wait for unknown period to receive your order. And even after several messages to Zara, no one replied or confirmed when I will get my order or even how to get my money back!",1
2019,Nice!!,5
2019,This is my go to fashion brand. Number 1 for life. Thank you ZARA for you're a SUPERSTAR A🌟,5
2019,"No way to sort products. Very weird/unclear descriptions. Products tagged badly, making the filter options filter out so much you should not use them.",2
2019,It keeps crashing. No wishlist. Embarrassing,1
2019,I have been delivered a damaged product (shoe) and its been already more than a week that i have placed a return request but Zara always says ' we will contact you in next 2-3 working days' don't know how many more days they gonna take.,1

2019,"Such a bad service for returned the item I have to called several times for returning the item they told me to will get tomorrow to pickup the order but never show...but when finally they show up for pickup the item they said money will be transferred to account after item reached it real place since it's been a more than 10 days the item reached it real place but money doesn't transfer back at my account yet ..the process take more than a month but money isn't not back, it was not expected",1
2019,Bad user experience in purchasing abd return request...no customer service and return policy is so bad that nobody gonna come to pick up the order and refund policy is also very bad 😣,1
2019,Best app I have ever used...,5
2019,Fantastic online shopping experience.,5
2019,Refund take to long to get back,2
2019,Nice app,5
2019,"Приложение и сайт отменяет заказы с оплатой при получении, помощь через чат отправляет звонить по телефону (помощь через чат бесполезная), адрес доставка не позволяет выбрать - заказ едет по первому адресу в списке использованных, возврат средств через предоставленные данные карты тоже работает нестабильно - сначала не приходят сообщения на почту, потом средства не проходят через банк",1

2019,أسعار أوڤر جدا,1
2019,"Ther user interface is very friendly and easy to use and also an extra feature on the app is the wishlist, we all know what it does. The only problem that I personally have is that the website doesnt support/have a wishlist which is kinda annoying yet still if I take the app for an app. I have no complains, yet.",4

2019,Good,4
2019,Good,5
2019,I don't get my money back. I have given a correct account number but zara app autocorrect a wrong IFSC code. My worst experience!,1
2019,"No ability to sort by and every time I click into an item it resets the search and I have to scroll through hundreds of items again you get back to where I was - this would be ok if there was a heart option where you could shortlist, but there isn't this option either. It just makes using the app extremely frustrating - it's frankly much easier in a browser.",1
2019,Too slow and hasn't opened only since a week,1
2019,Its terrible,1
2019,Hey guys you can't purchase from ZARA online store if you live in country side because they do not have delivery option for people outside of the major cities. Very dissapointed.,2
2019,Slow response. Too much fancy image made it so hard to download. The screen keep freezing. Finally give up because i had a headache just scrolling to it. Just keep it simple and user friendly please. I want to find what i need quickly.. no need to be impressed with fancy images and head spinning layouts.,1
2019,cannot add or update address...,1
2019,Good,5
2019,❤its good,5
2019,Well Its good,5
2019,Zero support or customer service,1
2019,Poor search,2
2019,This is a horrendous experience. I can't find anything.,1
2019,Doesn't give you an option to collect from the nearest shop,2
2019,"The app does what it's supposed to, but it's difficult to see the products because of the over-artistic pictures and frankly it's pretty annoying to have to scroll through bunch of pictures with the model's face on it (like why are they even there?!). Sometimes simpler is truly better Zara. Another great improvement to this app would be better scroll down feature, because it often goes crazy and opens up random things when I just want to see more pictures of the product.",4
2019,Nice,5
2019,"Love Zara clothing and like the app too. Works well, no real glitches. Just wish I'd get notifications thru the app when things I've saved and added to my cart are made available and/or back in stock.",4
2019,Bestest app ever,5
2019,Very Expensive,1
2019,Prompt delivery,4
2019,Was great before. But now they have stopped service in my state. Asked cc but they weren't able to answer when they are going to resume their services in my state.,2
2019,Not user friendly. Website is easier,3
2019,It keeps crashing and I lose my basket full of carefully picked items. It's a pity!,1
2019,I can't see the angels,3
2019,I will no longer be a customer of zara's bc their courier tforce is the worst shipper in ratings and have lost my packages and neither Zara nor tforce will reimburse me for their mistake.,1
2019,"worst products ever, i ordered shoes and they started losing their colour now the colour is all over my shoes and they are now spoiled. This is what the international brand zara provides. Don't be a fool to purchase from them online",1
2019,I am unable create my account in the app. My phone is OnePlus 5T.,1
2019,Would have given 5 stars if there was a favourites button or save option. Don't want to go through hundreds of pics to find what i liked. Other than that very nice app.,4
2019,"Tarda mucho en cargar las imágenes, es muy lenta. No tiene chat, ni datos de contacto.",2
2019,App is glitchy and customer service is awful. I don't know why they bothered.,1

2019,"I have a problem with app always not complete if i want to now the items is available of stores Egypt ,or not .",4
2019,Easy to use,4
2019,One of the most thought-through apps I have interfaced with. Very user friendly and picture quality and details is exceptional which makes shopping online not such an intimidating task.,5
2019,"Works okay mostly, but is quite heavy on data usage - a setting to receive compressed imagery is welcome. Beside that, the UI is shoddy at best; it can be a pain to navigate. And to top it off, you can't even make a wishlist - something I think is widely regarded as a universal feature of shopping apps. Embarrasing for a multinational of this size.",2
2019,nice,5
2019,I love it ... I ordered online and took parcel at the store .. amazing ggggggg,5
2019,I opened the app several times but it keeps popping up the ad for subscription of the newsletter. I already subscribed but it has continued to block my access to the site.,1
2019,There is no way I can track the delivery schedule.,2
2019,"I am so annoyed today, just sent an email for the newsletters for upcoming online shop for PH and it keep asking again and again. I cannot open the app because It kept asking for an email. worst",1

2019,Great,5
2019,Product are not good,1
2019,Great,5
2019,The loading bar on top never stops and is EXTREMELY annoying!!! Very slow as well!!,1
2019,It's terrible! I do not recommend downloading it.,1
2019,Difficult to navigate. Tries too hard to be dynamic and creative when all I want to go is look at clothes and sizes. This app makes me dizzy and my head hurt. Also difficult to find sizing chart and delete old addresses.,1
2019,nothing to describe just wowwwww🥰🥰🥰,5
2019,"Everytime you go this app ,everytime any selected outfit is unavailable or else no size available, y then they keep those outfits pics unable to understand, its waste of time, at least try to bring stock back or better delete those outfit",2
2019,Amazing App!!! Very Advanced and easy to buy.,5
2019,I'm in love with this 🥰,5
2019,"Its easy to navigate around items, its making the things happen 👌",4
2019,I dont know which programming language the developer is using in this app but the app is very slow and products take time to load especially if you want to go one step back. I think the app needs more hard work to be optimal,2
2019,Cannot find width of boot or shoe,1
2019,"The location page for in store availability information literally never worked. Wouldn't hold the keypad up long enough to plug in a 5-digit zip code, and if you found the patience to pull it up 5x to punch in one digit at a time, it wouldnt load the info anyways. I finally uninstalled the app in fury after unsuccessfully trying for probably 10 mins. So frustrating",1
2019,I find the app to be extremely confusing.,1
2019,Best app,5
2019,J apan and iiion p,4
2019,Very good,5
2019,"I'm a SA user... Unable to create an account via the app. However managed to create an account via the website, subsequently then I could purchase via the app. Not an ideal way of registering.",2

2019,😶,1
2019,Not easy to navigate,1
2019,i love sukri,5
2019,Bad. Not letting choose the country and language. You apparently have to allow them to send you notifications in order to do that,1
2019,Good,4
2019,Zara is always do best when it comes to fashion,5
2019,"There's so much ""flashy"" graphics in this app that even navigation is clumsy. When on poor internet, the graphics seems to be prioritized before the products. Missing simple filter functionality.",1
2019,Easy to use and practical,5
2019,Quite slow ☺,4
2019,Just such a pain to even scroll through collections. I just want to see all shirts or all blouses and it seems impossible to find. User experience is nice if you feel like looking at a magazine but not if you feel like shopping,1
2019,You can't create a wish list. How can they not have a wishlist capability? Baffling. Nonetheless the app is sleek and easy to navigate.,3
2019,First time to do it,5
2019,Cool,5
2019,Very slow and very frustrating app,1
2019,Good customer services,5
2019,Great app. Very fast and stable.,5
2019,I spent over an hour picking babies clothes with a subtotal of almost 2 thousand and closed the app to do some other things before u edit my items and pay and 57 items later my shopping cart was empty so very unimpressed,1
2019,Worst application ever very slow; hang all the time ; closed when you chose clothes and put clothes i didn't chose it,1
2019,Zara India doesn't ship to Northeast India. FRUSTRATING especially because other shopping sites ship to every nook and corner of the Northeast region. Even the app needs to improve. Why does it take too long to load the pictures!?,1
2019,"Please the barcode is not working with me , if you do not mind tryvto fix it cuz i always use the app , thank you.",5

2019,No possibility to save products. There is no FAVORITE section where I can save my favorite items until I decide to buy them.,3
2019,Incredibile,5
2019,Zara provides us a best clothes shoes etc in a reasonable price. My opinion is that Zara such a big company but they produce all level of price things which play a vital role for the persons who love to wear branded clothes at reasonable price.,5

2019,good,3
2019,"One of the better shopping apps for general shopping experience, which still has it's flaws. Zara somehow set my billing address as a random combination of collection points used previously (spanning over London to Belfast) which created issues confirming my identity with their customer services team. The in-app chat system is useless too, because as soon as you switch apps momentarily to refer to an email, it assumes you're innactive and closes down the conversation and you have to start again.",3
2019,app used to work fine. On Samsung s10 yet problems with camera and scanning.,3

2019,"Return n refund policy sucks... And sometimes customer service is of no help. most of the time, the given no doesnt work... Will have to think a lot before i place my next order...",1
2019,when you inform to use the online app make sure you added all the emirates without excluding one (Abu Dhabi) and when we contacted zara inorder to explain why there is no abu dhabi since there is dubai ! the answer is you have zara shop in abu dhabi or you can swnd it to your friend in dubai if you have! ok why then its online order !?,1
2019,crazy,1
2019,"Very good app for shopping as it is user friendly. I have a suggestion though. While the purchase is being processed, customers should have an option to edit the purchase to change sizes or quantities for example. Well done team.",5

2019,"Pretty good and I'm overall happy with the experience. But I do find the app slow at times, or making me scroll all the way down to where I left off before I opened an item. I also wish the app had user ratings on the items.",4

2019,"Man findet einfach nicht das was man sucht.

2019,To find an item the scan product barcode no longer works. You have to manually record the numbers. This feature was very helpful when shopping in store. Everything else is great.,3
2019,so disappointed with this app the sale was supposed to start at 9pm for the app user. impossible to access it on time. it kept saying we don't recognised email and password🤬it was working perfectly fine at 7pm,1

2019,good,4
2019,not good,1
2019,not easy to navigate. chat option does not give you access to staff who have access to store inventory information .,1
2019,Customer service on chat sucks stinky hairy balls! Seems none of them know if they are coming or going. I wasn't asking them to solve a math problem. I only asked them to help me change the currency. Seems like a pretty simple question to me if you know your product you should be able to guide the customer. Train your customer service people. Terrible experience from the outset. Meh,1
2019,Zara has the best clothes,5
2019,amazing,5
2019,"Auto selected my address and had to issue a return, then reorder it to the right address. And now some items I ordered are not returnable and I have extra items and a loss of over 3k.",1

2019,"your app is as pathetic as the attitude of the people working at zara. I'm it's soo ridiculously bad, I can't put it in words.

2019,"aplicatie de 2 lei, am pus in cos produse sa le am ""favorite""si fara macar sa ies din aplicatie mi a disparut tot ce am adaugat la aproape o ora de scroll. useless app",1
2019,Offers no information about the status of your returns. The chat is useful but when you have questions about your returns and providing item numbers is difficult having to flip back and forth between screens. Zara should be able to have information on the items you are returning. You have the ability to select the items you are returning on the invoice (which is great) but that I formation is not provided to customer service and you are asked to provide all the item numbers.,3
2019,love the delivery speed and the quality of clothes,5
2019,"App isn't working, its lagging and not loading at all.",1
2019,can never sign into my account,1

You don't have to wait too long to get your items, the quality of the clothes is great,is easy to return things although I would like for them to have the option to exchange an item for something different, that's the only reason I give then 4 stars.",4
2019,Not good,1
2019,good so far,5
2019,if i open a product in the middle of the list and try to go back i have to scroll from the top again.. its so much irritating..fix it so that i can start from where i left not from the top again.,4

2019,"I love shopping in store but it can be very messy the one i go too, so online would help but I hate the app layout I use zara and H&M alot and i prefer the H&M app its easy to navigate and it is just layed out all together 90% better zara's just is like a mumbo jumbo I dont use it for this reason",3

2019,not like the app at all,2
2019,always updated with my purchases and info on shipping and delivery to store. Love the app 5 stars!,5
2019,"What's with the new nav? We use instagram for stories, full sites for full seaching with upfront categories! I just cannot work out from a product perspective what you're trying to achieve hiding categories and funnelling users into preset product offerings, none of which may be relevant.",3
2019,It will be nice if you organize your products by gender like H&M,1

2019,why I must go to store to buy this product.. zara must can to delivery to customers,1
2019,very good app i love it,5
2019,"What's happened? I used this app all the time to choose and purchase my items from Zara but they've changed the menu settings so you now have to choose a 'story' of clothes (Dresses, Join Life, New) before you can actually see anything. You can't simply see 'all' womens trousers, or 'all' tshirts because they're split into these pointless groups that mean nothing. Whilst searching for a belt I had to search in 3 different sections. It's a freaking belt, not a needle in a haystack! So frustrating",1
2019,"Worst customer service. Contacted them 4 times about my package and all they say every time is that it's delayed and they can't do anything except to track it. I could've done that. I ordered my package last dec. 27 and suppose to receive it Jan. 2 but nope each week no package came. Never experienced this problem before, I don't even know if its lost or what smh",1

2019,"I am quite dissatisfied with the customer service. Last time I raised a query on the defect product that i received, but there was no response from their side. i never had any issue shopping at Zara, their products are good at a reasonable price and i always choose Zara over others. i just want to request ""to double check the product before shipping them, to be more attentive to customer's request and queries.""",4

2019,difficult to navigate...why cant it be formatted the same as the desktop version? click womens then shop different categories. terrible app to browse.,2
2019,it's a very good app and really enjoy using it. It's easy and quick to process transactions and provides an excellent online shopping experience. it is also user-friendly and very practical. However there's only one problem- it allows a certain number of order visibility as I'm able to see only 10 orders online and the earlier ones for some reason are not visible. This is a serious issue. I access to Zara app from my Samsung Note 5 smartphone,5

2019,the app is really good l have not experienced any problems. l do wish they have an option of putting items on a wish list for items you want to buy later.,4
2019,I find the layout of the app really difficult to work my way around. There is no 'sort by' filter and finding what I am looking is difficult. Uninstalling until there is a better update to the UI.,1
2019,What kind of tracking is that? Horrible QR CODE,2

2018,"App doesn't provide an option to revise payment after accessing issue with first payment.

2018,"Not the greatest app considering how popular Zara is, you'd think they'd invest in designing a user friendly app...Its so awkward at times that I just give up... its important to make the shopping experience a good, fun and easy experience..is that not the purpose of online shopping?.🤣 I love zara's clothes but mate this App needs reevaluation 😘",2

2018,"There are no product reviews or measurements of garments. I cancelled an order on the app before the item was delivered. Unfortunately, my money is held in a holding account and hasn't been released. I called and they told me I'd get it the following day. That day has now come and gone and there is no sign of my money. Also, some items come In and out of stock but you cannot get an email notifying that this product is back as it doesn't have that function on some products. So you have to check yourself.",2
2018,slower than old version. fix it please.,1

2018,very helpful,5
2018,You are selling this app with the feature of product reviews. Yet it has none. I honestly don't see the point of the app. Unless you need to find a store. But then you might as well open Google Maps and visit your website.,2

BTW the app is now telling me the jacket is in stock at another store... should I go? Also the chat feature doesn't work. Useless",1

2018,Cool,5
2018,Good thing,5
2018,No one can beat Zara ... It has its own class!,5
2018,It is very n8ce,5
2018,Very easy to navigate.,5
2018,I would love if there was a wishlist option. But I really like that it remembers my cart so I don't have to re-find things.,4
2018,Good quality,5
2018,Great app for shopping,5
2018,Not very intuitive app.,3
2018,It's nice,5
2018,Fabulous,5
2018,Online order not availablr,2
2018,worst app to purchase online,1
2018,"I have been using this app for sometime now and it's very handy. Specially with introduction of the filter option search is made more easy as compared to the previous version. However, I believe the filters can be improved.",4
2018,"Really deceived by the product I received. The shoes were tried on by many customers, and to ship it, they did not take their time to clean up the shoes that were covered of dust. Left foot shoes looked really old with major scratches, right foot has minor scratches. I think for a brand like Zara, business must be handled in a professional manner. This is the first time I ordered from Zara online and I am beyond deceived. I bought this boots for my graduation, but I don't think I'll put it on on the graduation day.",1
2018,I had a horrible experience using the app for the first time i have been charged abd received an email asking to finisg my paynebt when it accepted it already,1
2018,Should be improved so much more...,3
2018,Best clothing brand. Easy to use app.,5
2018,Really slow to load content.,2
2018,After the update it is not possible to check online availability. It is pointless to browse and not be able to get info on sizes and store availability of the product. Used to be much better app.,2
2018,Good,4
2018,Its the best app,5
2018,Amazing collection..i loved it,5
2018,"I had an older version of the zara app. it asked me to update and with notification it asked me accept permissions to storage, camera, phone, contacts, SMS, location and microphone. Literally everything! why do you need SMS? why microphone? half the permissions are shady af! when I didnt accept it just last night right before black Friday the app updated itself and got access to all permissions! I didnt agree to any of that and this is against the consumer law! I need this to be reviewed and someone get in touch with me!",1
2018,👍,4
2018,Beautiful,5
2018,Doesn't show balance from gift cards,2
2018,Worked for me for early access to black Friday!,4

2018,Fake,1
2018,Gud experience quality products must recommend. 😊,5
2018,There is absolutely no point in this app there is no option to purchase at the end. Basically i spent 40minutes selecting styles & sizes to not be able to checkout at the end. Do not waste your time!!,1
2018,I don't like it as I have returned the shoes I needed a smaller size and it says they'll refund the money back which I didn't wanted I just need a smaller size,1
2018,Great,5
2018,"Brilliance! Amazing shopping experience, really seductive application.",5
2018,Just loved it,5

2018,Return process and refund is smooth. Thank you,5
2018,Okayish,5
2018,Cannot sort and filter extremely difficult to find what you are looking for,1
2018,It is still not possible to pay via the app. I have contacted the service many times and installed new versions but the problem remains the same. A little bit waste of time for me.,1
2018,Excellent,5
2018,It's great,4
2018,Provide some offers or gift coupons to attract more customers,5

2018,It's really good and I appreciate it,5
2018,Worst app... Actually the reason i gave it 1 bcoz when i try to return my courier... They didnt make even a single response to make it happen and the clothes i get were the worst in my whole life and even they were just kinda playing with me like every time i made a complaint about it and they were like yea sorry for the inconvenience it wont happen again... And then nothing happen at all,5
2018,Very slow to load,2
2018,Very good app,5
2018,Incredible,5
2018,Costumer service is just too rude and unhelpful,1

2018,Very good,5
2018,amazingly,5
2018,App keeps crashing everytime I try to chat. Shopping cart keeps losing items added which suddenly reappear later. I'm unable to login. Shows that password is incorrect despite entering the correct one.,3

2018,Ok,5
2018,Feeling just too boared to say anything,4
2018,Update: The new filter update is amazing! Makes the shopping experience so much easier and better. Why is it that Zara still doesn't allow customers to filter by size? Such a simple feature that is incredibly helpful to customers hence why pretty much every other online fashion stores have had this feature on their websites and apps for years,5
2018,Excellent,5
2018,Best part of my life.,5
2018,"Too slow, not user friendly",1

2018,Pretty much what i wanted.It has everything for a person who has a good dressing sense. The app is less user friendly when we compare with other online shopping apps.,5
2018,I went to the store 3 times to collect one item and they wouldn't let me collect it since the wifi wasn't working.. the manager didnt even apologise and asked me to come back for the 4th time.. the least they could do is inform the customer not to come to the store if they are not willing to give the product or home deliver it if they have such major issues with their internet connections.. HATED ORDERING VIA THIS APP.. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER..,1
2018,This app is so good,5

2018,😂😂challll,3
2018,Much better than before.,5
2018,I ain't a hardcore supporter of ZARA but I found that they are innovative and keep improving time after time. But unfortunately ZARA is going way backward in their design and not the old ZARA it used to be after 2014.,5
2018,It is good,5
2018,I love it,5
2018,Okie,4
2018,Great app,5
2018,Lovely variety,5
2018,Best,5
2018,Not user friendly at all. Rather go to the store and buy. Their shipping charges are exorbitant. No proper tracking available on the app for online purchases. Use this app for reference and window shopping and if you like anything buy it from the store not the app.,1
2018,"It automatically change my UI to Chinese and sometimes in SC, and there is no setting options that could change it! The customer service is not helpful",1

I wasn't able to type anything else... What a joke...",1
2018,It's my favourite online shopping,5
2018,Best app!,5
2018,Worst experience. The customer care number does not work. Got a defective good and its been taking ages to refund. Not reliable at all Never ordering again.,1

2018,Pathetic UI. Can't sort or filter items. The chat is pathetic. Quality of chat is way below those of games with chats,1
2018,"Worst app and worst customer service I have returned 1 kid jeans, Its been 20 days now and they didn't refund my money till date even they have not initiated the money to bank till date, unprofessional and irresponsible team they have. My customer care experience is also very bad.",1
2018,Best app,5
2018,"Love the app, great customer service",5
2018,Most unresponsive application and not to mention the worst customer assistance chat service ever. Solving an issue is far away they cant even greet or start a conversation and keeps you waiting for 20 mins just after they say hello. I wish i could zero star this,1
2018,I do enjoyed it..keep it up,5
2018,Worst service provider. Its been 2months and i still did not receive my refund. Very irresponsible crew members,2

2018,"Worst app, donot rely on this app.. even after placing your order you need to continuously followup with customer care to get your order delivered.",1

2018,Recently i received a false material that i had not ordered. So i returned the material and requested for a refund. Now the zara help line just called me and accused me of cutting the tag that was on the material that i had not oreded. The department cannot just blame the customer of cutting the tag without a legit proof for their own selfish purpose. I give you -10000^n for your support. Thank you,1

2018,"I have been purchasing alot from zara but then last week, the sandal which I received was of UK 7 both the pairs but the right one was a cm larger than the left one. I contacted the customer service team through chat, I had to chat with 5 of them and explain the issue again and again the 5th person understood my issue and told me he would contact me through mail after 1or 2 days but then I never received the email. Zara never disappointed me but customer service me very very very bad. Trust me!",3
2018,Very easy to use!,5
2018,Home store.,5
2018,Crashed frequently on Android.,3
2018,"I love the app & clothes, but I just have a hard time looking for things I like & fit without FILTERS & ways of SORTing the clothes. Please work on that because I know I'm not the only one who needs those two. Only complaint I have.",3

2018,A bit difficult to find items without having the right filter options,3
2018,Horrible application in terms of Shopping!,1
2018,Why does Zara need all the new permissions such as access to photos? I am not convinced that a retail website requires this many permissions.,1
2018,Easy to shop & make returns,5
2018,You can get best fashionable outfits at very reasonable price,4
2018,Excellent,5
2018,"Super helpful ! I personally love the app version rather than the web version. Searching is very easy, and purchasing is very convenient. Would be more helpful if they give filtering option.",5
2018,"Quite a bad app. It is not intuitive and has zero filter options, you get lost in all the options",2
2018,I m in love with zara .,5

2018,No filters,1
2018,Worst service ..esp the refund and delivery service ..got a wrong parcel and no one is taking responsibility.,1
2018,5 star,5
2018,"Second time I undowload this app. It won't give you setting to search, the whole this or nothing at all. You should allow customers customize their search.",1
2018,There should be the option to check status of return goods.,1
2018,I have the Greek version of the app and the translation is hilarious! Guys you should have spent a buck for a professional instead of going with Google translate!,4

2018,Collection😇,5
2018,Brilliant app. So easy to find what you want and the checkout process is quick and stress free. You can even just tap your card on your phone if you have NFC. Take a bow Inditex. Well done,5
2018,Zara is awsm,5
2018,"Filters would be good idea. Also tracking exact delivery status, location etc. The size check is based on mean analytics, however I wasn't sure whether it applied for me individually.",4
2018,"If i could sort by color, material, design...etc., it would be much better.",3
2018,"Not user friendly. Back button on my android phone escapes the app entirely. Also, it did not save my cart.",2
2018,👌,5
2018,The best shopping app,5
2018,"Can you please add filters on the display page? It's inconvenient, especially if one wants to compare prices.",4
2018,Nice user interface,5

2018,Lags a bit and you can't have a fav list,3
2018,I want to ask. Why can't I sign in in this application? It makes me hard to shop.,3
2018,"Super slick, intuitive, and most importantly, got me to spend lots of money",5
2018,Really disappointed with the chat function... Mid convo it will come up with a message stating.. you have been inactive for a while so be believe the query has now been resolved. I cannot retrieve the same conversation and would then have to explain the whole thing to another agent on another chat window :o,2
2018,I spent 2 hours shopping n making a purchase which the purchase was cancelled 6 hours later. What a waste of my time! Unreliable app.,4

2018,Great and love to shop zara anyways,5
2018,"Worst. Customer service, pick up for return does not work",1
2018,loved it,5
2018,It needs a wishlist function. Otherwise you need to to search for things everytime.,4
2018,It says invalid address even tho it's my adress,1
2018,Good,5
2018,"Fail in some of the basics needed for an App: search for items awkward, no wishlist option to save items that you are interested in but don't want to buy straight away, don't have a track your order option. Service and delivery great though.",2

2018,Love it,5
2018,Awesome,5

2018,Indian dresses are not there morr,3
2018,Delivery is so late,5
2018,Pretty efficient!,4

2018,Need alot of features like selection sort by type,3
2018,Good catalog...help me in searc dress or T shirt,5

2018,"As much as I love the brand and the products, the user interface of this app sucks!! I really hope they work on it.",1
2018,Good,5
2018,Loved it,5
2018,Awful search engine. Not being able to filter the clothes you want to see is really time consuming.,2

2018,Excellent,5
2018,I love Zara my favorite store,5
2018,It's good and afordable,5
2018,Naam bade darshan chote. Pathetic refund and exchange policy. If you get defect in quality they are not accountable and apart from there after months they revert that it's not tge product defect. Poor quality od customer satisfaction service,1

2018,There are some translation inadequacies in Lithuanian.,4
2018,nice,5

2018,Best shopping app experience.,5

2018,Nice products,5
2018,"The variety of apparels on the app is a LOT more than the variety available in most stores. Super easy to browse and shop without waiting in those never ending lines at the stores. Purchases are delivered within 2-3 working days, very well packed.",5

2018,It's cool,5
2018,Best,5
2018,"People plz don't buy shoes from Zara quality sucks ,it just tore in 4 days use and worst part is they didn't refund r exchange it because I used it and not just one both shoes tore due to poor stitching . Stressed out with the customer service . No justice served feeling cheated.",1
2018,Nice,4
2018,Stupid app for big company that's not good at all,1
2018,Why do they need access to my Bluetooth in this new update !?,2
2018,Application is broken since you've opened online shopping in India. Highly disappointed. Still broken after multiple weeks.,4
2018,I wish it shows the same options on the app as it does on the website. Plus it does not take you back to the same page,4
2018,Fast delivery,5
2018,Dislike the photography,1
2018,V expensive... not affordable for normal people...,2
2018,I love this brand,5

2018,Simple but different way of browser,4
2018,Its good,5
2018,Soooperrrrrrr,5
2018,Good fashion app,5
2018,WE NEED FILTERS,3
2018,"I'd give it more. If it let you go back, instead I have to leave the app and go back in. Ordered ok tho. Clothes great. Would prefer if they showed the matching items, instead of having to look them up. Particularly the suits.",4
2018,Why all those access permissions?,1
2018,Delivery in indore india,1

2018,Bestest app ever i have used it many timEs delievery is very fast best app,5
2018,"Amazing, beautiful quality products, super quick delivery, fuss free returns...What else you need!!",5
2018,Zara is the best among all orders apps Quick delivery in less than 7days. God bless zara,5
2018,Please break your collaboration with DELHIVERY as they make fool of us that today your product will be delivered even after calling them everyday also they dont have th contact nos. Of local delivery offices when we ask them for contacting our local delhivery office. WORT,1
2018,Nice,5
2018,Why the hell Bluetooth access is needed in the update ?,1

2018,Good collection,5
2018,"Why does this app need bluetooth permissions, and access to contacts?",3
2018,Loved it,5
2018,Love it. Mostly working effectively,5
2018,Very easy to use! The only thing I don't like is that it's so easy to use it's making me broke haha 😂,5
2018,Nice products,5
2018,"Zara using cheap trick of showing higher price for shoes and gives discount on purchase ,after purchase I found that discount price is actual price of shoes.",4
2018,I always prefer Zara it's the best shopping app to shop,5
2018,Good app and everyone knows zara gives you best design in the market. Then why not,5
2018,Some updates to be done in separation of gender.,4
2018,"This new version requires so many invasive permissions with no apparent reason. Why do you need access to my camera, Bluetooth information and call information now? Uninstalling.",1
2018,"On the latest update, the app asks permission for my camera and bluetooth. Not necessary. Will be uninstalling and check Zara out on a web browser or the store.",2
2018,Perfect,5
2018,What the hell are all these new permissions?,1
2018,Brilliant service and app,5
2018,No offers,1
2018,I love this brand.. thats it,5
2018,ZARA has the best clothing collection amongst all the other online apps.,5
2018,"Zara is playing with us. I bought a chelsea boot recently which was not on discount it was around 60$, and now they are selling the same product in discount but the thing is they increased the original price of the shoe 110$. And the discounted price is stilp the same which is 60$. That means they are selling the products at the original price showing the customers that its on discount. CHEAP TRICKS",2
2018,Works great in NZ..,5
2018,Nice,3
2018,There is no cash on delivery,3
2018,"Closes are great, but app could be better. I miss ""favorites"" option: to be able to save closes that I liked without putting them in basket. Still didn't find where to sort items by price.",2
2018,I want the money writing in Europe money,5
2018,Awsome,5
2018,Sometimes should be updated little bit more faster...but the rest is fine 😀,5
2018,The best clothing line for me.,5
2018,"Brilliant, love it!",5
2018,Why don't add Albania in Zara store?,3
2018,I think that zara should include exact measurements of all clothes so that we are able to justify whether the size can fit nicely upon we make purchase and reduce the chances of goods return.,4
2018,Store availability not working in Egypt,1
2018,Very good app.I live in Kolkata and we have only one outlet here but still I ordered a jacket from the app and got it within one day. Loved it.,5
2018,App defaults the purchase to store pick up when I could have done delivery. Only aware of this after payment is made and conformation says to pick up from a particular store without the option of delivery or even choosing your preferred store.,1
2018,Does all that it needs to.,5
2018,Gobar,5
2018,(check in-store availability) option not working right now in Egypt and seller man told me every time i go this products not available Right now and i a sure he hide them,1
2018,"I love zara.. this app is easy to use, and I enjoy to buy my favorite brand. 💕",5

2018,Perfect and love the alerts when items are back in stock. Beautiful clothes and easy to use site.,5
2018,Simple to use. Always accurate and up to date.,5
2018,Excellent!,5
2018,I hate to compare but the Mango app works better. Aside from showing how much an item costs this app will be so much better if it shows what store the item is available in and even order thru the app,3
2018,Excellent,5
2018,Good app but app is too slow and varities of clothes is less than showroom of zara,3
2018,Well organized,4
2018,Amezing,5
2018,Seems cool.,5
2018,Bohoho,5
2018,the app was fine but why I can't order on line to KSA ? It's really making me upset because I like Zara and I love the different clothes there making !! please solve this problem ASAP !!,1

2018,"Super glitchy, sometimes doesn't load anything just shows spinning circle. Account application form: doesnt have enough digits to put full phone number, address auto fills ALL IN ONE LINE not to correct fields - what's the point of that?",2
2018,This aplication is awsame,5
2018,"great app, great outfits",5
2018,"Horrible navigation to customer service! App needs alot pf changes to fit customers needs, and advantages to navigate site.",1
2018,"Simple and effective.does the job.my first purchase is still on the way,so have to wait upon that",4

2018,"It goes without saying that Zara is one of the most valuable brands in the world. I tried to place an order recently where my card was charged but the order was never placed. Spoke to someone at customer serivice desk and was asked to wait for another 12 days for the refund to fallback into my account and place a new order altogether. On top of that, the agent claimed that I did something wrong while placing the order which doesnt make sense to me at all. Extremely disappointed with the customer service I received. This is Zara I'm writing about which is one of.my favorite brands.",3
2018,Great app experience!!!,5
2018,Good app but Zara's customer service is something I don't wish my enemy - too brutal. Couldn't get my package nor my money,2

2018,Thanks,5

2018,"No preview, just an ad telling you to download the app. The formatting is off as well - the text is cut off.",1
2018,The return process is too long 10 to14 days and there is no exchange if a person orders a big size he can get the smaller one he has to return it and then seperately please another order that's Zara there are other shopping apps too which provides me refund within 2or3 days maximum and there is return option too know it's your choice where you want to go.,2
2018,I downloaded it so I could see a preview for the online service that is launching mid march but it shows a few pics one of which encourages me to download the app to see a preview... hmmm not so smart.,1
2018,No Australian preview. False advertising,1
2018,"The zara app is an absolute nightmare. I have been messed around by customer service for the last few weeks. They have not refunded my account, nor have they sent the items I have paid for.

2018,"The delivery and ordering were smooth. But the online customer service for refunds was unhelpful. Refund was delayed and I was not notified. Repeated website errors during my returns procedure.

2018,Makes shopping a pleasure. My favorite shopping app. Well done Zara.,5
2018,Awesome,5
2018,"Works well in some aspects, but poor in others. My main frustration is that the 'Pay at till' button brings up a QR code that is not recodnised by the tills when your payng with a gift card that has been loaded onto the app. To use a gift card in store, you have to navigate back to the wallet screen and tap Gift Cards, and provided you have internet access, your gift cards will appear. This is usually not a problem for the ladies, but if you're a bloke, you'll always have problems with the signal as the Mens department is more often than not, located in the basement. Most of the apps functionality relies on having an internet connection. It would be great if you could scan an item and it save it in the cache until you have a connection. Otherwise, it's a nice clean app and relatively easy to navigate.",3
2018,Nice,5
2018,The collections are countless !! Very confusing about which one to buy and which one not to!,5
2018,Smooth,5
2018,I wish there was an option to filter the selection. Right now you need to go to every product and check for availability.,4

2018,"I cant find sydney in the maps, is the US the same as Australia? Does the clothes from the US season match Australia?",3
2018,🙄🙄🙄,5
2018,it's amazing😍😘,5
2018,"There isn't a filter function for size etc on the app as there is online, very annoying",3
2018,Good,5
2018,Clothes are good. Application sucks..,1
2018,"Awful customer service, not worth it to order anything online",1

2018,love it,5
2018,"Beautiful design, easy to use.",5
2018,It's just great!,5
2018,This is very good app for shopping,5

2018,Loved it best brand,5
2018,"So far, so good!!",5
2018,"Dope app. Ease of use, HD pictures and simple interface.",5
2018,"As a South African, it gives no options for my country or currency or codes . It didn't recognize it all, even though they have more 5 outlets here. filters are horrible and navigation on the app has no direction. I hate.I guess now I have to go to the store directly as an online shopper",1
2018,"It's a clean design, well thought off",5
2018,Easy way.Fantastic,5
2018,"I find it very hard to navigate. There is no real menu, just submenus that feel like they do not get you were you want to be.",3

2017,"Everything,out of stock 😒",1
2017,A wishlist or favourites option would add value to the app + sorting the clothing via size (at least). I get bored browsing through every single item for hours until I find if my size is available at all.,4
2017,Product is available in the shop then also it doesn't appear in the application,5
2017,"I like the app, however, what made me rate it 4 stars and not 5 was the fact that it feels very limited. Other than that I like it.",4

2017,Good,5
2017,Excellent app,5
2017,Love this app,5
2017,"For now I'm giving this app three stars. It is easy to navigate and I do like the way the clothing is presented. What stopped me though from giving this app five, or even four, stars is that you cannot filter or sort clothing. It could be a marketing ploy of sorts but it is something I find annoying to the point where I find the app a turn off. Also, something that is not necessary, but I always like it when shopping apps have a ""wishlist"" or ""like"" option for products. It makes it easier find or remember the products you love but are not ready to buy.",3

2017,"The fulfillment center does not provide visibility as to when your order will be shipped. Finding out when your order will arrive is also hilariously inconvenient to check on. The 24x7 chat function is not available through the application. So going to the website through your browser is necessary for additional support but you run into the critical issue that the chat service actually doesn't provide support for customers or online purchases which blows my mind as to what their purpose is. Fast forward to the calling the only number listed at all which happens to say ""customer service"" doesn't actually help consumers either or connect you with anyone. They give you an unlisted number to a fulfillment company who staffs people who can only order or provide instructions on how to get a refund. They also give you a date range of delivering products from the day you order through 30 days out with zero visibility to where your 600 dollar order is. She did mention to order a better shipping method which made no sense since you cannot choose your method and she didn't know what carrier would be used. Back to the application, slow loading, fit feature isn't compatible, sizes are not uniform across their own brand, models measurements aren't provided just their height which makes no sense either. Overall it makes considerably more sense just to go to their store so you can actually get your discounts, get your product, get straight answers, and not deal with this inept Spanish/Turkish fashion company's poor operations and development team. In short, the application sucks.",3
2017,Best,5
2017,In terms of fashion & new trends 👌,5

2017,"While pressing the cancel purchase button on the order section, I think a popup asking if I really want to confirm cancel should appear. Last time I was checking my purchase and I mistakenly pressed cancel button. I immediately received a message saying my order has been canceled. As I didn't want to cancel the purchase, I contacted Customer Service and they said there was nothing they could do and asked me to order again.",1

2017,It's a decent app. My only gripe is there's no wishlist option on the app or the website. Figured it would have been added as a feature since the first time I placed an online order but no dice. Other than that it's cool. Nothing special and gets the job done for the most part.,4

I live in Philadelphia and normal would shop at the Philly store on Walnut St. But that's store is Sooo DIRTY AND DUSTY, it make it hard to want to buy anything. Their cloths, Shoes, handbags are always DUSTY and dirty . The Sales people are not friendly at all. So I choose to order online. Can't wait for another store to open some where else.",5

2017,"Previous version was much better. Many links including ""in-store availability"" are put below and you have to scroll down a lot where you used to access it easily from the menu on top right corner. The size selection menu of the products while adding them to shipping bag does not match the sizes on the in-store availability menu. For example if the sizes of a certain product ranges from xs to xl; you can add the desired size to your shopping bag but cannot look for the in-store availability for the exact sizes. The sizes range from s to xxl. So weird.",1

2017,I like this app it has what I'm looking for,5
2017,The best app 😊,5
2017,It's pretty easy and simple to operate. Though sometimes loading picture is too slow. I wish there were more filters to find specific products easier. It also helps to indicate the size that the model is wearing.,4
2017,It doesn't deliver in India,1
2017,There should be an option to filter available sale items by size. With the existing setup you are required to search through tons of items until you are lucky enough to find something available in your size. It seems like common sense to me.,1
2017,That's Good,5
2017,"No filttering, sorting or favorite!",2
2017,Excellent,5
2017,Pathetic app. Useless too... It good for nothing ... No online purchase neither its shows aaviblity in different cities al over country It jus shows nearby one city and own city. In my case it was showing aviablity in mall near me and in actual it was not available!!!! Highly disappointed Neither othr city store arrange delivery neither own city store took order . The pune store manager said he cant arrange d product to be delivered frm diff city in their store...its not the case in other brands. Highly disappointed. .its a common sense someone wud nt travel to differnt city just to buy product. ... Also zara store manager should be enough polite to appreciate that someone is so keen on buyin d product,1
2017,Such an beautiful app,5
2017,Excellent,5
2017,Love Zara and love having the ease of the app,5
2017,The app is probably great but not available in Australia.,1

2017,👌👌👌👌👌,5

2017,"You can't do fine grained filtering, so you are forced too see items not in stock. I'd tiresome seeing pieces you want and then realising that they don't have them over and over again. And you can't search on sizes, basically you can't search on anything. Useless.",1
2017,It shld have online shopping,3
2017,Awesome,5
2017,"Love the Zara app. Very easy to find what your looking for. Sizing and info about product is top notch. The only thing I wish they did was tell us what size the model is wearing seeing as they give us their height. So maybe adding size with height so we can get a visual idea about sizing, due to Zara being Europe sizing.",5
2017,Love brand,5
2017,This app is amazing and easy to use I do more shopping at Zara's because it's so convenient. Too many features to point out individually but they are all great.,5

To check if the L-sized jacket was available in any of the stores, so I used this app. It was easy to use and the Scan feature works well. It recognised the correct jacket. To know if the jacket is available in nearby Zara stores, it first told me to choose the size. And the options given to me were 02, 03, 04, 05, 06. I am unsure what to make of them, and I found this very unintuitive.",3

2016,"Zara has one the best shopping apps available, and the clothes are awesome. I love that all of my purchases are stored in the app. Using ""my digital Zara wardrobe"" helps me put together outfits without the hassle of digging through my closets. Most importantly Zara's clothing is always high quality, I never regret a purchase made or have to worry about an item ""going out of style"", this clothing is timeless!",5
2016,Perfect!,5
2016,Please guys the time is now .,3
2016,Amazing,4
2016,Would like a filtering function and add items to wishlist. It takes a while for non available items to stop displaying and/or show that they are out of stock (don't know until you actually try to buy them). Not being able to cancel an order due to repeated technical errors.,3

2016,I love this app! I use it daily. I love being able to easily shop online through this app rather than going in the store!!,5
2016,Fyi - What you are accepting by tapping 'approve' is that you allow the app to have access to pretty much all the private info on your phone. What's up with that?! Deleted the app right away..,1
2016,Gimana cara belinya. Kok gak ada. Mau beli banyak. Sayangnya gak bs,1
2016,Always up to date... easy to use and even easier to buy... Love zara... and LOVE using this app... my life is complete! !!,5

2016,Works smoothly and glitch free for me.. I hope it provides online purchase option for Indian users,5
2016,Why Australia is out of the list?,2
2016,The price is low. But it doesn't fit with my style. Bad fashion!,1
2016,"Very easy... and doesn't change deals based on ur IP location, unlike other brands...",5
2016,Showing sale stuff in stock that never actually is-for a few days in a row! Annoying!,3
2016,Can't believe in a country like india you don't deliver products online..useless app for indians,1
2016,"This app is usually pretty good, however on several occasions, items shown as and added to basket, are actually out of stock when you open the basket. Not sure if this happens on website too? Very frustrating!",3

2016,"The app is amazing and so are the products in store, you could fix the barcode scaner, but I don't think that it is an important for the concept of the app. Amazing! Love your store, so much affordable clothes with style. My favorite store ever!",5
2016,What's the use of the app if there is no buying option available for India on the app...,3
2016,"And that is something that probably can be done by google. But zara is not google. Mango divides it by categories man, woman, kid, etc and then you can see options for each of them.",1
2016,Not for Australia,1
2016,Update price in cart if item goes on sale. Otherwise I love it😙😙,5
2016,"Contacts, really?",2
2016,Why do you need my contacts access??,2
2016,awesome collection,5
2016,"The app may be ok, but the permissions it requests to get installed are just fabulous: browsing history, bookmarks, pics.. A shopping app doesn't need all this, you're paying for the clothes, don't need to pay with your personal info too.",1
2016,Accessible,5
2016,Superb app,5

2016,"It's so easy to shop and convenient. It's more efficient than sales associates. I'll be in the store and if they don't have my size, I'll buy it on the app or go to the nearest location. Great omni - channel experience",5
2016,Why is there no option to create our accounts if we're from India? Because if the app doesn't give us the permit to shop online from India then this app is useless for us! I suggest you to check the below comments cuz most of them are from India. I recommend you guys to introduce it asap so that we can also make use of the privileges available in the market.,2

2015,"I've used the Zara app for about 5 purchases now. Interface is nice but login is always full of bugs: doesn't recognize my email as an account. Then doesn't allow me to create a new account. Doesn't allow me to renew my password because it can't identify that I've typed the confirmation password. I have to go through this process every time for a purchase. Upside is that I've noticed nfc credit card function is now available. There was also a prompt to save the receipt in my gallery, all nice touches.",3
2015,"Well designed app with the easiest user experience in mind. Faced issues paying with Greek cards though, debit or credit card. Collaboration with GR banks needed to improve payment process!!!",4

2015,"Overall is good...don't like sold out items to be removed when update other items in cart, may be create wishlist. No more edit basket....so I HAVE to buy everything I put in there???
