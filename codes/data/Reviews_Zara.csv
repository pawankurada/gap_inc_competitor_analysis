2023,"Amazing experience, recomand",5
2023,the app is slow. everything is out of stock,2
2023,"website never works, app is the bomb, clothing should be pictured in 1/2/4 grid options for quick scrolling and able to move fast through sections the app has never been user friendly for fast purchases. two many of the same clothing options are featured in 3 different versions (just colours variants) in different spots on the page, put the same item grouped together with the colours then move onto an item it doesn't make it clear to customers the item comes in several colours=loss of sales",4
2023,"I purchased an article while in France but I couldn't retrieve it in time. I was told I could be reimbursed but it never happened. The chat is very slow, turns off very fast to the point that you have to restart conversation everytime. None of my interlocutors were able to give a proper answer.",1
2023,"Write the model's height, so that I don't have to return the stuff that can only be bought online. Also, your measure of items are not always accurate.",4
2023,"Awesome clothing,love the fit and style",5
2023,Not a good app,1
2023,delivery takes too long,1
2023,"This app hangs too much, just a big no.",2
2023,"Worst app..nothing can be seen on the app except for menu items. If I click on any menu item, only blank image is displayed. And yes FYI there is no internet issue. My remaining apps are working absolutely fine. I have uninstalled it.",1
2023,cant do online return with shipping,1
2023,a lot of bugs in the app.,1
2023,"Love the products but payment is worst, gets stuck everytime.",2
2023,"Horrible online service. I don't know what kind of people working at their warehouse. They keep sending orders to wrong addresses and wrong stores for pick up. And then they can not even provide you any help. They are so incompetent people, if you buy anything buy at the store. And if you have to use their website or app, good luck!",2
2023,I love zaraüíù,5
2023,very efficient app,5
2023,J'aDore lots... Perfect ...,5
2023,This app is unreliable. It seldom works. You're better off just ordering from/ perusing the website.,1
2023,Great content and usability!,5

2023,couldn't select store for pick up,1
2023,After update I cannot see any item in the menu. I just see a white screen that's it.,2
2023,The most irresponsible brand I would say. I've ordered some shoes from them. it's been 13 days since I ordered them.the courier service is showing for the past 10 days that the parcel in is my city but they are not delivering it.... and everyday whenever I go to check their website it extend 1 day for the delivery..e.g. today is 19 September when today I checked it says they will deliver it tomorrow I.e. 20 September. for the past 10 days they are doing the same trend. Zara is doing nothing abou,1
2023,Great app,5
2023,Why so many updates??,3

2023,I used to like it but the current version is terrible. everything is too complicated especially search and navigation.,2
2023,great service,5
2023,The latest version is very disappointing. Worst user interface I have ever seen. The design from filter buttons to font are ridiculous. The designer's ego has gotten in the way of creating a truly user-friendly experience.,1
2023,cool store,5

2023,"The wish list function is not working, cannot see pictures. Total pain have to go on my laptop to order",2
2023,"In regards to ordering/service- great app. However, certain items have been mismatched for about 6 months. Example- I create a search for flats and scan downward. The items could be off by 1, 2, etc. I'll click on the initial picture of flats I like. After clicking, the item (on the previous menu) just before appears, and so on. Droid phone/app",5
2023,"Hi there, my friend had this app for long long time. After update, icon stayed the same but the name changed and there is no more option POD ?!?! The name of the app is design-system-compose, but it apears when you install it. Is this copy or what?? You are robbing people or your app is compromised???",1
2023,Awesome,4
2023,"Bad app with very bad customer service , their customer service always use the same lie; we will contact you later regarding your issue..... then you will never hear from them again. Just a cheap way to lie to the customers. The app itself is very bad and slow, the fact that you have to see a model showing you the product is kind of old, nowadays most apps have the option of showing the product on model or no. Your cart will disappear suddenly so you will have to start over!",1

Uninstallling the app till then.",1
2023,The worst eCom user experience ever. The buying and finding experience was much better before this ridiculous and unnecessary design change.,2
2023,"Incerc sa aflu informatii legate de un retur prin chat. Se raspunde extrem de greu si cu 0 informatii utile, la un moment dat le am spus ca nu imi raspunde la intrebari, mi au spus ca am o atitudine si mi au inchis chat ul. Am deschis alt chat pentru a face sesizare, mi s a inchis si acesta, pentru ca nu voiau sa imi dea o adresa de mail unde pot face sesizare. Mentionez ca nu am folosit cuvinte nepotrivite, doar le am mentionat ca nu mi au dat nici o informatie.",1
2023,Good for me,5
2023,"Everything seems to be good! The clothes are good, and the quality feels on par seeing the price tags. But, i have one suggestion, why would there not be an option to review the clothes or other accessories we purchase on your platform? Well, the platform like H&M has the option to review their products. Hope you guys look into it.",3

2023,it's the worst website I've ever experienced,1
2023,the app has some bugs!,3
2023,Zara's clothes are of very poor quality. His clothes look good in the photos on his app.and the surface of their app is also not good.Zara's clothes are not good.

2023,"The new UI update is terrible, unintuitive if I may say.. The previous one was much better, and the app is much slower for some reason. I really love your clothes, but the new updates are actually a downgrade.",1

2023,‚ô•Ô∏è,5
2023,"Everytime I open the app there are no photos or pictures, just the writing. When you click on an item to look at it and go back, it takes you right back to the top, quite frustrating when you have already scrolled through a hundred items. Please please update it or change it back to the original format.",1
2023,Frustrating app. Logs you out on it's own. Can't even log in again.,1
2023,"Apparently, you have added the option of ""scan receipt"" just recently which is great. But it's not functional. I mean when I open that new option, I get things like : Add ticket, Scan the product QR. However, nothing happens when I click on those two features! Would you please solve this issue as soon as possible. Thanks!",3

2023,"Got really bad.Once was my favorite app, I used to order a lot. But lately I often can't get authorized, every time it makes me change the password. I talked to support but they just told me to change password, and then try again, and then try from pc. So now again I'm out of my account and I can't log in.

2023,"The latest update is a disaster: 1. If you click on an item and click back, taken back to the beginning of the list. Clicked on item halfway out of 400 items clicked back and sent back to the beginning of list 2. When in Special Prices/Sale sections can only filter by Size/Colour/Price, no filter by Category. If I'm just looking for bags I don't want to scroll through 100s of other items 3. Sections are too basic e.g. Accessories/Jewellery no direct link to Scarfs/Sunglasses/Belts anymore.",1
2023,"So annoying. You click to view a product, you press back, it takes you back to the top of the list. This happened with the old version too. Such a basic function that doesn't work",1

2023,"Very good App, excellent functionality, and frequently updated. Before use, it is helpful to check if there is a new update",4
2023,scammers! by far one of the worst in online shopping.,1
2023,The worst app known to mankind. Painful to use. Don't know what's worse the service on their stores or the app. The only justifiable purchase is during the sales. Don't waste your money on full price items.,1
2023,"New version is awful, I can not select store for drop point. Button does not work.",1
2023,The latest update is very discussing. The app is very laggy and unresponsive.,1
2023,"2.new update is the same problem, pictures cannot downloading, I have to close and open again, can you update it??

2023,"Poor service, what they always do is to apologize, they kept my Order at the warehouse for two weeks even today it has not been delivered.",1
2023,Very slow seems like zara isn't interested in online stores.,1
2023,Having trouble to install,1
2023,I hate the sound with every click and i uninstalled it because i thought my phone is bugged and also no filter for the least price to high and high to low,3

2023,I ordered 3-4year baby jumpsuit and got 13-14year baby jumpsuit without outer tag i send him all pics and bar code but they denied to return and not accept their fault so I got terrible experience.we can't trust them,1
2023,With last update ..i cant bought anything..give error when i go to cart,1
2023,"Horrible UX, worse and worse since 2020 I just took a little bit of my time to come here and give this feedback. I usually don't do this, but it's frustrating as hell and it keeps getting worse. Now they also have sounds, which even if you disable, you can still hear it. Images don't load at least 50% of the time in favorites(besides the weird way of getting there) It's hard to give an overall good solution to this. Just revert everything to 2020ish plus add favorites and that's all.",1
2023,since the last update I can't see any pictures,1
2023,Worst application using experience ever.,1
2023,After the update the app is laggin and I have to clear cache again and again.,1
2023,"I used to love the app but the recent updates are driving me crazy, the sounds is super annoying and I don't know how to nevigate with the new interface, I try to look for coats from sale selection but somehow can not. Also the most annoying thing is when you click one item and back then it went all the way to the top which I have to scroll all the way down to where I was!!!! Very bad user experience overall.",1
2023,Good,3
2023,Very bad user experience. Scroll is not working on most of the pages. Favourite list does not remember selected tab when you go back after checking some item. Very unexpected behavior.,1
2023,La nueva app no carga rapido ni va nada fluida. Ademas ese nuevo formato es poco accesible.,1
2023,"Since the update the list goes to the beginning after having selected some item for details, which makes it rather unbearable. Please, correct as it used to be.",3
2023,"The New layout is terrible. Make the navigation and the shopping experience difficult, why to change such a nice and easy app for this new version?",1
2023,Worst update ever got stuck pics don't show up ect,1
2023,"How on earth turn the annoying app sound off (even I disabled the sound in the setting, it is STILL ON!!!) NOT a fan of this version, please fix this!",1
2023,Scrolling bug,1
2023,"1 star for quality fabric, 1 star for latest fashioned cloth, -1 star for high shipping charges, -1 star for product unavailability(mostly), -1 star for bizzare cloth style, -1 star for 100 rs.returning fee = overall 1 star for Zara. (Shipping is free on purchase of a large amount of goods or else a huge amount of about 290 rupees has to be paid in the form of shipping charge, which is absolutely illegitimate. So I dislike it. )",1
2023,"Ever since the last update, I've been facing a problem where the images of the product wouldn't load. The entire app is useless if I can't see any products. Reopening the app or restarting the phone didn't fix it. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Which fixed it for 3 days, and now it's gone blank again. I don't want to go through reinstalling this app every time I want to use it.",1
2023,Your user interface has become so bad . It's like zara has just launched. Your UI was good before . Please change it back . Iltye menu option give me feeling like there are some sticky notes ‚òπÔ∏è Please change it back to original one,2
2023,"I used to believe - and would tell anyone - that the Zara app was the best, until the latest update turned it into one of the worst. I don't understand why you changed from the most user-friendly platform to the most frustrating app. Please revert to the previous version.",1
2023,"I dislike the tag-like layout of the items, in the menu section. Why would you complicate the app like this? Scrolling worked fine.",3
2023,It's the best app to keep your wallets empty.,5
2023,great quilty of clothing,5
2023,Real othentic quality,5
2023,"After last update (27/7/23) shopping cart is not available at all,you have some serious bug.",1
2023,Imagine doesn't show.,2
2023,it would be nice the app to notify us when prices of our favorite items drop. Sometimes the app crushes or is laggish although the internet connection is perfect. Some products in the store are priced higher than the online store.,1
2023,Sound is annoying! Even disabled it still sounds.,4
2023,amazing products. I love the quality,5
2023,"Latest update seems to have come with in-app sounds, which cannot be turned off, because I have sounds disabled in the app and I can still hear them. Drives me insane.",1
2023,Pathetic these guys and there delivery partners have screwed my hard earned money after giving all valid proofs there is no answer from zara Refund my hard earned money man,1
2023,"Can't disabled sounds and animations even when changing the setting. It's so much slower than the website also and the search does not work. If I look for something in the website I can find it,but not in the apo",3
2023,The app doesn't even open. Just shows Zara logo and nothing else.,1
2023,New update is aweful. Don't you have UX/UI team working on reserch? Its so not user friendly..i cant even navigate properly and i am a customer who litrally uses the app daily. So imagine! Its totally bad lauout and UI. The previous one worked fine. Bring it back pls.,1
2023,"I HATE the update 1, The sound is irritating and is always on, even when it's turned off from the settings. Why the sound anyawy? 2, The list goes back all the way to the beginning whenever any product is showing. (If i pressed to see a jeans, then i go back... the screen will go all the way up) 3, Some areas CANNOT be clicked, if i need to see the color options (the product is coming is different colors), well i cannot press on the color optios and the text is overlapping with the menu options",2
2023,I bought a lot of clothes from zara app and they had amazing quality and looked the same as it did on the photos,5
2023,Easy to buy and collect,5
2023,Remove the sound asap!Can this app get more annoying? No search options for sizes available. Keeps showing out of stock items. Now it also has an annoying sound every time I look at an item. Whoever designed this should be fired. It is not cool it is annoying.,1

2023,Good app,5
2023,"The last update is awful, too many lines, it hurts my eyes, why did you do that? The app worked perfectly. Maybe you need to hire a new frontend team.",1
2023,Terrible my app just updated randomly and now its impossible to use. 1 the layout looks so bad 2 when you look at a item then go back a step it will take u all the way to the top of the page and not where u last were. 3 when ordering the option to to pick up from store seems to not work been trying all day. Juat the overall layout is poor compared to what it was,1
2023,"This lastest version is the worst, not easy to navigate and not user friendly, every time we click on item to see it's details and then close it, it takes us to the top of the items list, very annoyinggggggg...

2023,"who the hell updated this good app into garbage, even garbage works and is useful...",2
2023,Super,4
2023,"Pointless, annoying sounds. Disabling sounds doesn't actually disable the sounds",1
2023,The more they are updating the app the more it gets unfriendly using. There is sounds and vibrations everytime I click on the items...very annoying!! But I am unable to disable it.,1
2023,"This new update is horrific, how does this app keep getting worse",1
2023,"Pathetic app and pathetic update. The new update looks like it's designed by some kid. Additionally, the service by Zara is pathetic too.

2023,Worst app... Please never order from Zara they take forever to deliver the order and also if you return then it'll take a lot of days for them to refund your money. Customer service is the most terrible thing about them. wish I could give 0 stars,1
2023,Zara always double bills my capitec card when I shop online. it's irritating because I always have to call the bank to reverse the transaction uurg,1

2023,online breezy purchase.. wider choice than in store!,5
2023,"Bad quality products, their sizes differ so whatever you order doesn't fit and have to return and then that charge you for return shipping. Charge you shipping for 'discounted items', just very bad brand. On app, sorting is a no brainer and they cannot get that right either.",2
2023,"Do not use this app. It is not convenient to purchase thru this app especially for returns. I tried to use the E-voucher they issued for the returned items to pay for my next purchase. I was not able to check out. The app keeps going back to payment mode after I scan the qr code. Their online chat is also useless. The delivery of items purchased is very slow. Same with returning items purchased. If you like Zara clothes, purchase from the physical store.",1

2023,"What happened with the app? In the newest version, I do not have my account, I can not add products on favourites or in the basket or buy a product from the app. Is this how it is supposed to be, or is it a major bug?",1
2023,The shopping basket is non existent anymore. Sometimes the option to add to basket disappears. Scrolling through a product is too sensitive. You end up showing product details instead of the next photo. The only good things are the chat feature (when someone finally replies) and how quickly the product availability updates,2
2023,It doesn't work most of the time.,1
2023,"Cart is not showing in application, please fix bugs",1

2023,Not better experience,5
2023,"This is not user friendly. Scrolling between product images is too sensitive and this new update is ridiculous. You can hardly see how to add an item to the invisible basket. Seriously, where is the basket?",1
2023,ok,3
2023,Terrible service. With product check they are very bad with product quality check and dont listen to concerns,1
2023,Crashing. Really bad UX. Can't log returns. Where did personal profile & basket or purchase history disappear to??? Why add an item when you can't find the basket to complete the trxn?,1

2022,Horrible app. There's a bug in the change invoice address section. Can't change your address where your invoices are sent. Can't assign a new address for invoices to be sent either. Quite an important part of the app that they need to fix.,1
2022,"Awful. Stock information lives life of its own. I specifically travelled to particular stores relying on stock info and the goods weren't available. I repeated the same after few weeks - no change. Both times it showed ""available"" and both times store staff didn't have it. That's in several stores, not just one.",1
2022,shipping is expensive put your store on lazada for cheaper shipping,4
2022,Terrible app. Chat kicks you out after a few minutes saying I've been inactive and I've been waiting for them to respond? I'm supposedly talking to a real person on the chat but it's clearly robots asking the same questions over and over and taking 10 minutes to reply each time. Issue with ordering vouchers has become so complicated and time consuming I've ended up taking my business elsewhere. V v v disappointed Zara,1

2022,If negetiv starts are available there I must give -5* to zara. Simply the worst service I have ever experienced. Purchased a jacket and the packaging was worst. Purchased a perfume set for gifting and they came in damaged condition due to worst packaging. When I tried to return they denied to get it and when after so many time of complaints they accepted the replacement instead of return and picked the product but they again sent the damaged ones and told me the store denied the return.,1
2022,"Worst shopping experience ever, I always shop from the shops in Jordan ' , however I shopped online on black Friday, the order took more than 10 days to be received and the pants I got which are a part of the order is wrong and not what ordered, when I tried to contact the help center, both times Christina and may have not helped me and were so rude Im never shopping online again PS this is was in Jordan",1

My wish lists keep being deleted after the selected product is sold out in the subjected location. Well what if I wanna create my Zara seasonal mood board and later buy them in an another country? However there are few important good qualities which is that the app reflects true match colours and forms or very close to reality. More creativity pls!",2

2022,"Such a trash app. Viewing things and going back to previous page will take you back to the initial state, not where you last were. Items only show out of stock once you're in the process of payment. Can't believe this is acceptable. Horrible application that is not user friendly at all.",2

2022,"Absolutely nightmarish UI, completely overloaded, the same item gets shown multiple times, scrolling requires skill and experience because there is about 15 different ways... Much like the offered products, it's all about looks and no thought given to the user-friendliness and comfort.",2

2022,Not seeling perfume,1
2022,it hangs,4

The zoom in picture and pictures or items are really bad. I hate their shopping experience, it makes you frustated. At first I thought it's just me I'm not clicking on it properly, but it happened like 50 times. You can't be just the leader in market and have shittest experience for users.",1

2022,Application is not working smoothly,3
2022,"First time writing a review for an app, and I'm doing it because it's really frustrating to use the app now - in many ways. Perhaps the app developer can test out from an user end from start to finish to know what I mean. Some examples include kicking me off the page when I'm browsing through the pictures, and when inserting address to check out, it gives me the option to click on the preset address but when I do, it doesnt set the full address - instead it only displays the street name.",1

2022,really cute selections!,5
2022,"the site is easy to make purchases with once you find the items, but selecting the item size and quantity is unnecessarily hidden. It seems like they're trying to hard to be different with that step. you have to add items to the cart to get to the size/qty selection and then hyperlinked under that is a size guide. Its uncommon for sure...if that's what they were going for. Once you figure out how to order, everything else is easy.",5

2022,Love love love this app! It allows you to store favourite items for future purchase (as long as your size hasn't sold out) and if you like an item that doesn't have your size it will let you know when it comes in stock. Also has a scanning device that you can use instore for an item you can purchase online if it is out of stock in the store! I wish more shops had this facility. Downside - I spend too much money on it! üòÇ,5

2022,Don't support our region,1
2022,Better than shopping via website which is confusing AF. But this app stll needs work... Not very intuitive e.g. why does the menu come up blank? Why do I have to swipe UP to view more images of a product? Not sure the developers did any proper UAT.,3

2022,"I absolutely hate clicking on a product, and wanting to swipe up to see more images of the product, but the options bar pulling up almost every time.

2022,I have my Samsung z flip 3..this app doesn't work perfect with it..I have android 12,1
2022,Too 'edgy'. It's hard to see dark clothes because of how they photograph them. To view images on a product you swipe up...but that's also the same gesture to view the item description. I cannot even view the product images because despite swiping from the middle of my screen the description still comes up. I appreciate how innovative the design of the app is but it's too much.,2

I dont understand why you always trying to upgrade something but it's actually a downgrade, way too many step to go to the wishlist, and while you going into an item, its send you all the way to the begging of your wishlist which is really annoying. Honestly the app is really really bad and it doesn't make you want to order",1

2022,"They do not return the delivery charges, where H&M, Myntra, Ajio, Flipkart they call return the amount. Even after the product are not of proper fitting the do not return the amount, Never ever going to purchase from Zara again. Disappointed. H&M is better.",1
2022,Return policy is the worst. I have not received my refund yet.,1
2022,"The app is ok if you only want to browse stuff and make a purchase quickly, otherwise it's pretty redundant. You can't chat, you can't do curbside pick-up, you can't notify the store to have your online order ready when you are close to the store, you can't do detailed tracking, you can't amend and in-store availability is inaccurate and lacking. Even if you have the app, you still need to manually 1) call 2) walk to the store 3) stand in line 4) use fedex tracking 5) chat using website (usually a dead-end). Customer service is non-existent and if your order gets lost or delayed - well, you SOL. Zara is cheap for a reason.",1

On the second last day of second delivery period when I checked the app... It says the order has been cancelled without any emails any calls.

2022,Your parcel never reach on date,1
2022,"The last update has made it so much more difficult to buy anything from the app. The Wishlist is made in a way that you scroll through the items,look at one in particular,and once you go back you need to scroll from the first item again. Also the other features are much more complicated now. The app was better the way it was.",1
2022,"No problem with the app so far but today I got an alert saying ""Zara app appears infected, immediate unistallation is advised"". Did this happen to anyone else?",3
2022,Too many bugs on the app Everything is literally out of stock and when something comes in stock not able to add in cart... Worst shopping experience,1
2022,Great,5
2022,"In my opinion they don't use RecyclerView because when I scrolled down the memory is overflowed and threw out from the app. So just a friendly reminder dear developers, please don't use Listview! (just Google it why RecyclerView usage is a better practice than the Lisview) Thank you, if u read it dev team!",1
2022,Flagged up as having a virus so deleted. Was not the easiest app to use - tended to just go on the website on laptop to make purchases as easier to browse. Style over substance.,2
2022,This app might be infected with a virus. Got a pop message saying this app was infected with a virus and to uninstall app,1
2022,"""Security threat. ZARA appears to be infected. Immediate uninstallation is advised.""",3
2022,"This is more of a reach out to the development team, my phone detected some sort of virus within the app and advised to remove it immediately.

2022,"Changed my phone and as a result I couldn't get into my account, so naturally I tried to reset my password as I thought it was my fault. Well not exactly. I couldn't reset it via the app for the life of me, the promised mail never got into my mailbox. I did manage via the website, also hard because of the app, and then the new password is not accepted by the app. That's absurd. Before you ask,yes,I have the latest version installed.",1
2022,best quality products,5
2022,3 star for the brand. Please reduce the delivery shipment cost. 300 is too much for a shipment. Anyone can buy a tshirt for that cost. Please do something for the out of stock problem too. Thankyou.,3

2022,"A useless app. You cannot use your password so you cannot pay for your items in the basket. You change your password, and was told that they sent a message to your email, and nothing. Zara, you need to get your act together.",1
2022,"Worst service, its been 13 days i haven't got my refund and whenever i try to enquire about my return/refund it shows app is not responding. And also there is no separate space for your return items detail and refund details.",1
2022,Nice,5
2022,There is no proper way to get in touch with customer care through the app. Those who reply on chat are least bothered. My order was cancelled by Zara and only the cost of the item was refunded. Delivery charges were pocketed by Zara. Customer care has no idea of why the order was cancelled or why the delivery charges was not refunded.,1
2022,Trash customer service.,1
2022,"App is good, product quality is okay too, but I received a clothing which was worn by someone from at least 2 weeks and they sent it back to zara after damaging it and they sent it to me without checking that the quality of the jacket was bad, there were no price tags or protective coverings on it, stitching was coming undone in many places. I've been a loyal customer of zara and this experience was really bad for me.",2
2022,"Terrible app, I bought items within the app, after a few days neither my wife nor I can login to our accounts, it says both our details don't match. Unable to reset password either. I have deleted the app. Now I can not login on website either. Worse than one star",1

2022,"The worst app and customer services . I'm trying to return some items and once I click on the' return ' it deletes all the selected items and restarts . I've tried it 5 times and have a lot to return. No luck. The chat servise sucks,they dudnt respond, phone customer agent was way too slow to sort it and the line cut off or she just hang up on me. Absolutely terrible experience",1

2022,Wouldn't buy anything from this store as I bought jeans from here and the zippers break easy I would order try them on and the zipper would break... I called the store about this they happily replace the first pair then the second did the same thing just by trying them on. Pretty well stole my money total of 195 worth of jeans. Since then I tried to call the store right after I opened the package and tried them on they said that there was nothing they could do for me... really sad.,1

2022,Its not user friendly,1
2022,"worst application, Zara is such a good brand please get a better application. It lags and your costumer service is like helll no response .",1
2022,Their chat support is bad. And the refund policy is the worst. They don't care about the Coustmers.,1

2022,"Absolutely useless app. You can't update your personal details, website you cannot login because straight away you get log out for inactivity.

2022,"The most pathetic app I have see. They will show items are available and when you go to pay you will get a message that some items are not available, but they won't tell which ones are not available if you have more than one in your cart.

2022,"Great layout and user interface in my opinion, easy to find what you're looking for or just browse. My 2-star rating, however, is a result of maybe what's only been an issue for me. The app will not let me add anything to my basket. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the issue persists and is really irritating as I then need to go onto my laptop if I actually want to buy anything and find the individual items AGAIN.",2
2022,"Great app for shopping but brutal for returns. Every time I start a return it never emails me my shipping label. Every time, I have to contact customer care to get this re-sent to me and it's such a hassle. They ask me for my order number, email address, tell me that they already sent me the label and I said I never received it, then they make me verify who I am before resending the label. Complete hassle. This process really needed to be fixed.",2

2021,Error Ï°¥Îßé,1
2021,A reputed brand with daylight robbery. I bought a product which charged me with delivery fee of 290 rupees. Without my consent they cancelled my order and refunded only the product amount. I will be okay even if they don't refund the delivery fee if I was the one who cancelled the order. I think they should first let the customers know if I want to cancel the order. Not buying again from this brand.,1

2021,Top class quality guaranteed,5

2021,Return service is extremely extremely slow. Concerned authorities do not arrive to pick up your package for weeks together & refund takes further few days to process after the package has been picked up.,2
2021,Orders take long to get delivered. I once made an order on a available item. After a week I get an email saying the item is no longer available... howü§î Sizes are incorrect most specifically on jeans. I would rather walk 5km in 10 minutes than order again from that app,1

I'm surprised a big store like this could run such a poor app. I think the one star rating I gave was too generous,",1

2021,Great app and great quality products.,5
2021,My experience has been awesome on the website. I get a few kinks bit for the most part. It works great.,5
2021,I've waited 2 wks for my order only to be told that my main item is sold out. I then requested for the entire order to be cancelled. The online chat is unhelpful& frustrating. I've messaged 3 times and my chat history just gets cleared& you have to start from scratch and repeat yourself all over again. It's like talking to a robot. In the end they wouldn't allow me to cancel. Saying its already been shipped though the status shows Being Prepared. Before I can respond they end chat.Pathetic!!,1
2021,good,5
2021,I ordered on Zara a Jean and a tshirt and I have marked the return for t shirt they said it will take two days atmost still no one has contacted me.,1

2021,App is not working. Everytime i open the app it shows connection failure. Not able to access anything.,1
2021,Great app but there is a problem in customer care so if you can improve it then it would be 10 stars .,5

2021,Good,3
2021,Terrible service in that you wait forever for your stuff.They need to make a plan so that it works efficiently.By the time your order comes you have forgotten what you bought.Very disappointing üòï,1

Very frustrating I spent hours trying to figure this out and even the assistant talking to me had no answers! Sorry to moan but this was nearly a day trying to sort out! I shall not be using this site in the future.,1
2021,The most stupid app I've ever used so far... what's the use to always update the app with a size so large enough to delete the other apps?? Why can't we even open the app when it's not updated?,1

However, their app warned me that a jeans are out of stock. After replacing it with another pair of jeans, I found out that two sweatshirts are also out of stock. So, I finished my purchase with a dress, pay a shipment and didn't purchase items that were on sale. Is it a fake sale?",1

2021,"Even though there is an option of cash on delivery, my order is getting cancelled automatically due to this mode of payment. And I m asked to pay in advance",3
2021,Great clothes,5
2021,"My all time fav. I prefer this brand only. . Highly recommended to others. This brand follows current fashion, awesome quality, great fittings, I am in love with this brand. No other brand ever take place of this. When I got introduced with this brand 5 years ago, I didn't get any other brand in this level. This website is good. Once I made mistake on my address, but customer service is really nice, they helped me like anything. Wanna write more, bt less space. ALWAYS BEST EXPERIENCE HERE.",5

2021,It sucks in android. Please make it smooth and great like in iOS,1
2021,Great,4
2021,"The app is visually pleasing and I especially like the fact that you can go from an item to the next with a simple swipe. It has all the order-related details at hand. On the negative side, the filter option could work better. If you select on option (ex: ""long sleeves"", certain price), it wil not include all the items that match the description. It should also include a price filter from cheapest to priciest and viceversa. I'd also like a black backgroud option. All in all, a good experience!",4
2021,App is great but customer service despicable. I returned 2 orders in one box to save them postal fees. Unfortunately they said one item was missing from box and wouldn't refund me. A staff member told me it was an internal issue being investigated. Either way I didn't benefit. So people do not oblige. Take photos and return separately,4
2021,Zara online worst app I have ever seen send my order another address still not refund customer service not available no one response cheated with customers. Can't chat on app .,1
2021,"As much as Zara is known for its premium in-store service, it's pathetic to say the least in its online services. A classic example of why it's not easy to go online if brands can't change their operational strategy. Been more than a month and still waiting for my refund of two orders.",1
2021,"The worst, I tried to reset my password and followed all the steps needed and I didn't receive any email in order to reset it. I contacted the chat from the app and someone there told me that they didn't find my detail contacts in the system, I sent a screenshot with my last order and my contact details and she told me that my account my have been blocked. And beside that I returned a product from last month through the app and nobody came to pick it up. The woooooorst!!!!",5

2021,"I had ordered a product from Zara recently,but unfortunately the delivery address was mistaken as it was supposed to be delivered somewhere else.Since,it was my first time experience with Zara, I didn't knew that it'll be so awful experience I'll ever had. I have several times made an attempt to customer care services to sort out my problems regarding the refunding of my amount, but everytime they're making an excuses. It's almost been one and a half month,still my problems hasn't been sorted",1
2021,"Bought 4 items, received only 1. When i asked why, the customer service told me to wait for 3 days. After 3 days, they asked for another 3. And its almost a month but no answer. The customer service chat needs improvement. Cant open other app or the chat is disconnected.",5

2021,Cannot find Size guide for trouser. I should have read the review before registering zara - I agree with all that is being said about the site - RUBBISH,1
2021,"Zara's clothes, lovely. Zara's app, less than pathetic. Service is WELL below par. All I wanted to do was load a payment card and it's just a nightmare.. They can't find the reason and so it's a shame.. The WhatsApp customer service takes days and you still can't get the answers you need to progress.. Zara, please invest in your website and app.",1
2021,No variety to see. Limited stock,1
2021,"My account has been deleted apperantly for no reason so my purchase history is now lost. I have made a new account with the same email and now I cannot load the application as per my location and currency. Chat technical support is SHOCKING !!!

2021,Very bad app cant select the country,1
2021,"I can not order, it says error no matter if I try it using web or app. And customer service didn't help me at all (((",1

2021,Love it,5
2021,Worst app in the world. Idk why they have filters. They are useless and as results are shown products that are out of stock. It's nerve recking. Lots of patience is needed to use this total bs of an app.,1
2021,Everything is out of stock even the new collection..so what's the importance of the app !!,1
2021,So disappointed app which takes money from account and don't proceed the order.,1
2021,Bad customer service,1
2021,Love this app,5
2021,"Whoever was UX engineer on this has done a horrendous job. Apart from difficult to access categories, the product view, arguably most important thing,is garbage. You have to scroll up to see different images of a product, but since there's another event(product details) attached to swipe up action at the bottom, you bring up that instead of image change. And when you perform swipe up higher, because thumb moves in more of an arc, it changes the product(horizontal swipe action triggers) Worst UX.",1
2021,Worst app ever,1
2021,The worst and the baddest customer services Once you purchase you will never get your money back even its damage don't use Zara online,1
2021,Purchasing online from Zara is a completely different experience than purchasing from their shop. I bought online a jacket and after a month it started shatter at the sewing. I requested to change the item but they decided by only a picture that it is my fault. I am going to take the case to the South African small court and I will never ever purchase online. Im Zaras customer for almost 20 years (I bought almost every clothes from Zara from Hungary). I'm very disappointed at the moment.,1
2021,Accrurate size estimation for more than 95% of product. Easy to see. Good pic and ref,5
2021,"Can you do something about your customer care please, it is pathetic",1
2021,"There's some nifty features in the app and visually it's nice to browse, but it's missing some basics like remembering items I have put in my cart the next time I come back to the app.",3
2021,Easy and user-friendly,5
2021,Worst shopping app ever. They keep postponing the date of delivering my purchase. I regret ever spending my money on this online store. Now I am just trying to get my refund back. There is no contact number that you can call. What kind of a store is that?! I wouldn't advice anyone to use this app.,1
2021,Wow good,1
2021,"Great for the most part. Not sure if this falls to the developer but it would be great to have ""Sold Out"" items not show up in the filtered selections, why do I need to be tortured by items no longer available.",4
2021,Ok,5
2021,"Most of the ui elements work half of the time. Can't create an account and every couple of months the app decides that i cannot log in.. Update: now not only I cannot log in, now even creating a new account is impossible.",1
2021,"Items were cancelled without sending any notice via email or whatsover. We tried contacting the help centre but not much help at all!! No reason explained, just told us to wait for the refund for 14 bloody days and keep checking it with our bank!! Wow so much help.. should change the name to USELESS centre perhaps!!!",1
2021,Pls don't use this app for shopping..continuessely rejected my order and courier partner behaviour is very bad ... totally waste of time ...,1
2021,"I'll suggest that you opt for store purchase instead of ordering items online. Zara's customer support in one of the worst service I have ever encountered. But this inevitable as they have a customer support without a feedback system. They'll will make you feel like they are doing some favours by talking to you. You will never get a follow up from them, they are just rude and don't care at all. If your refund is stuck then forget it, you are never getting your money back.",1
2021,Cant cancel an order because of a technical issue and contacted customer services to cancel and took to twitter as well. No response,2
2021,Pathetic service by zara.sent me clothes having blood on it and on box too.2 different size tags on the same trouser & no tag on 1 trouser.how the zara is premium? Can't see anything to upload photos or video of the clothes.shame zara.,1
2021,Everything is fine. It just won't take account details which means you won't be able to return.,1
2021,Website is hard to navigate.,1
2021,Items just dissapear from the cart. If i put items on cart..have to buy immediately otherwise if buying later they wont be in cart.,2
2021,There is no indication that an item is out of stock beforehand.,1
2021,Really easy to use.,5
2021,Thoda price jyada otherwise it's fab,5
2021,"NOOOO compren nada por la app!!!!!. Cuando tienen que devolver la ropa van a la tienda y la plata despues la app te lo devuelve... Ya paso m√°s de 1 mes y aun no recib√≠ nada. Llamas a la tienda no se hacen responsables te mandan hablar con el chat de la app. Ya voy hablando 4 veces con el chat ""Marta"" y el robot siempre me dice lo mismo que me van a contactar.. as√≠ estoy m√°s de un mes esperando. NO TE DEVUELVEN LA PLATA Y NADIE TE CONTACTA. MUY MAL SERVICIO! Desilusi√≥n total con zara!!!",1

2021,Aaaand here we go again. Can't log in in the app,1
2021,Wrost experience in zara app I returned the product but I haven't received my refund max30 days is over,1
2021,NO REFUND! I've been contacting the customer service about a refund and they're just dodging it by saying that I'll get an email. But no further process has been done. When I asked to talk to the manager the agent KICKED ME OUT OF THE CHAT! PATHETIC! I wonder how Zara is saving money by not advertising and not giving refunds.,1
2021,The worst application and experience with zara India. There is no update on the delivery and neither any response from the customer care. The delivery status automatically updated to customer not available/ address closed. Did not even get any call before delivery nothing.,1
2021,"Worst low grade cheap quality products.. I bought a shirt which got torn on the first day I wore it. Customer care is pathetic... I asked me to share images of the product and tags... At last they mentioned as it got torn due to use... How come a fabric gets torn on the first day of use? It can be only due to cheap quality of the product. Never going to buy again from Zara. Local vendors are far better. Disgusting, n felt cheated.",1
2021,Don't bother wasting your money and time buying online with this app. Your orders will get cancelled and you have to constantly follow up for your refund on an app which fails to load. Its really not worth the stress.,1

2021,Status of item is only showing delivered even after amount get refunded.,2
2021,"Customer service is very bad and Refund Money issue..return policy process so bad, and refund Money not received within 14days.. but zara product is good, quality also good, but customer service and refund policy is very bad. And delivery charges very high",1
2021,"It was my first Zara online experience and it was really bad because I had ordered for a Zara Puffer jacket but to my surprise the right hand sleeve of the jacket was damaged.

2021,Very uncomfortable to use,1
2021,Your customer care sucks. I tried to contact your customer care via chat and they take so much time to respond to your query and then automatically shuts down the chat saying you have been inactive for a while.

My 5k is stuck and there is no way of contacting them. Its already been 3 weeks and i have contaced them several times. I have no choice but to sought some legal actions. So much for being famous international brand. They cheat customer of their money and have no deceny to soleve the issue. Just please safe yourself of the trouble.,1

2021,Worst app ever. Always crashing. Can't do anything on it,1
2021,"Read this Review BEFORE INSTALLING this app. If you are purchasing, assume that you lost that amount. They say they have refund/replacement policy, but do not do a pickup and hence they won't refund/replace. Their measurements tend to be different from the other brands and hence its obvious that you would receive a mis-fit clothing. And their customer support is pathetic. Not available on mobile, NO email response and on chat you just have to wait for eternity. Very pathetic experience, didn't expect this from Zara given the cost of the products is very high.",1
2021,Best in class... Love the products... For those who are looking for unique & stylish... Go for it..,5

2021,"Worst app with worst customer care with worst service they didn't even reply you . Pathetic experience never shop online this is a scam they don't refund money, not expected such from this big company.",1
2021,Worst Customer Service,1
2021,ordered A set of perfume 100-100 ml each from Zara which is worth 1290 and recieved a 30ml man perfume instead. The customer care is telling me they escalated my return request but it's been 2 months and I've not received a single call or any email. They told me to attach an image but it was not possible because there were no attachment links. Totally disappointing. My 990inr are wasted on zara. And there's no way I can return this now. What to do ? I want my refund ASAP.,1
2021,"Didnt, checked yet",5
2021,Has to be the best shopping app thus far,5
2021,"I tried after I tried after I tried to try the right to write to him, try to look for him after a week and two days have passed.",1
2021,Poor service with poor app features and product,1
2021,Poor customer support,1
2021,Worst app.. i made return request .. and they don't repond at call.. contact facility is not available.,1
2021,El app no funciona las images tardan mucho en bajar en ocaciones nunca Bajan.,2
2021,"The app only allows you to register an account for United States. But on the website I can change the country...then you cannot register on the website either because everything you type will give 'incorrect parameters' when submitted, which is the most useless error ever.",1
2021,"Horrible service, item went missing and Zara customer service did little to help and basically equated that its my problem to resolve the matter. I had to constantly chase them and the staff were very rude and unhelpful the whole time even when they were in the wrong for failing to deliver.",1
2021,Favourite,5
2021,The worst online shopping experience ever. I orderd a pair of shoes and I waited for almost 16 days and I didn't receive anything and every time I contact the customer service they just say it's being prepared ...and when you cancel the order you need to wait for 14 working days to get your money back. Honestly I don't recommend anyone to use this app or to buy online from ZARA.,1
2021,"Zara is disappointing me so many times. I have orders showing DELIVERED when I never received, I have cancelled order without my concern while I was waiting for the order. I also have order which is partially delivered, yet I never received or get a feedback. Assistance in chat is very very poor. ONLINE SERVICES ARE VERY VERY POOR. OUT OF 6 ORDERS I ONLY RECEIVED 1 WHILE OTHERES WHERE CANCELED AND SHOWING PARTIALLY DELIVERED WHILE SOME STILL SHOWING IN PREPARATION.",1
2021,Mujahideens App...,1
2021,Worst app. Doesn't address to customer grievances at all. Never buy from zara online. No refund on returns and customer service is worst in all of online shopping . Not customer friendly . Never going to buy again from Zara .,1
2021,I ordered online and paid for it After recieveing the goods it did not fit and we have been requesting for return and refund for the last two months. After regular follow up the call centre representative asked us to go to store and return it. I drove 1 he to the store and here they say They have nothing to do with the online business. We have to talk to the online team Zara online is a scam Be ready to loose money if you buy Zara online,1
2021,Not customer service oriented. Zara needs to improve üò£üòê,1
2021,"Ordering is great, online support SUCKS!!!! Didnt receive an item in my delivery, NO HELP WHATSOVER, CHALK IT UP AS A LOSS, NOT WORTH THE STRESS",3
2021,When I try to log into my account it keeps kicking me out and saying that it doesn't exist even thought it does.This is ridiculous.I hope this gets fixed and also the Chat Service didn't help aswell.It is very hard to do a return because it requested more than once for me when I tried to return an item I didn't prefer.I recommend going into the shops instead of online,1
2021,"Being a global brand, invest some money in developing your application. It cannot even register a new user.",1
2021,"You can't erase adresses after you create them, ""help"" option is a joke... Chat disables after 1 min of inactivity and it takes someone >10 mins to respond, had order come up with wrong adress and no way to cancel or modify, honestly a terrible app in general and even worse customer service.",1
2021,I cant cancel any order,3
2021,I love shopping from Zara,5
2021,Poor customer service. Not able to file for return. And customer care too is not available.,1
2021,"The help centre (which is through chat on the web or app) is beyond teribble. I had ordered 3 products, but one of them got cancelled because they didn't have the product and they informed me that the 2 other products are being send. But few weeks later, again, they informed me that both of the products were also empty. And now because i wanted to get my money from the 3 products that i've been paid, i contacted zara chat for help, and the chat always glitch. Please help !!",1
2021,"Good products with worst service, Zara is a big name, do justice with service too.",1
2021,Worst customer support,1
2021,Great App... But when u want to make a refund...The bank details section is messed up... Just fix that issue,2
2021,Absolutely dreadful. Trying to purchase item online with Zara gift card and have to download Zara app each time. Very frustrating,1
2021,It didn't worked,1
2021,Cannot track the package and the worse live chat,1
2021,Love zara. Hate this app. And when i try to use their website the app opens without event though i dont want it.,2
2021,Not easy returns,2
2021,Terrible customer services. The chat window closes down on its own even if it has been left idle for 2 mintues. The customer service agents just don't respond in time leading to a closed chat window with absolutely no outcome. I raised complaints twice regarding an order but nothing happened. No body came back to me. The agents just mentioned we will get back to you in a moment and they are gone. I can't even track my complaints. If you are not willing to listen to us then just don't pretend.,1
2021,One of the worst applications I've ever seen and half of the time it doesn't work and freezes up,1
2021,Best online shopping appüëå,5
2021,Zara app is a let down . Even their customer service . Highly disappointing,1

2021,Not able to add sizes in the cart . Shows no size but when I looked up on the website and not the app the items were available . So the app is kind of useless .,1
2021,Amazing,4
2021,Please make side scrolling for item other pics.. its not easy on hand for uoward movement,4
2021,"Nowadays they have problems with shipping, I still not getting my stuffs but it shows delivered, so disappointing. It is going 2nd times",1
2021,"Ordered something they tried to deliver it to my house twice, unfortunately I wasn't home. I asked for my package twice on separate days where they told me they'd ask the delivery company to send to my house, nothing happened and now I'm not getting my stuff cause it's ""out of stock"". Ridiculous. At least I'm getting a refund, which might only get here in 14 days. Unninstal this devil app",1
2021,Nice very nice,5
2021,Horrible app with a horrible payment gateway. Charged me money which was debited from my account and then said my payment hasn't processed. They don't even have any customer care service that is easily available. Horrible experience,1
2021,"Can't return the product through APP, always let me type the correct address, it is the correct address, it's been several months, and they still don't fix it.",1
2021,Why does it keep locking me out of the customer care chat? Based on inactivity? I wait for the agent to reply and meanwhile it ends the chat because apparently i was inactive. i had to contact 4 different people to explain them the same problem and still got locked out. Why? Plus i had to make 2 payments and still my order was not confirmed. really bad experience with Zara app,1
2021,Gonna have to say no to Zara. Really liked them and still would. But they can't redeliver and they refund less than what was paid from what I saw. Not happy and won't be recommending or shopping here anymore. Shame really. They beeb around for a long yet they can't re deliver. They leave driver number who doesn't pick up either. Plus they drive all day so how can they pick up..? Looks disorganised,1
2021,"Highly disappointed, haven't received the paid online order even after 20 days n there is no proper customer care services to reply on this,only 1 customer care number for entire India,pathetic. It's really unacceptable from a brand like Zara!!",2
2021,Ugly app and the chat customer service is poor. Nobody responds properly and it sounds like pre-generated messages being sent everytime I talk to an agent. Horrible experience.,1

2021,So happy to use it,5
2021,Nice,5
2021,"Love the app but performance not stable. Love the ability to scan barcodes of items in the store, save, and search for availability online. However, the UX on scanning receipts for purchases etc is not easy to find nor intuitive. Once scanned, they are not always appearing in the ""in-store"" list under Purchases in the user profile. Looks like a bug here in persistence of the data and image. Another note is that items out of stock online, should have that status reflected throughout the app.",3
2021,Unable to login and customer support doesn't even bother to solve the problem at all,1
2021,They claim to accept returns but their app refuses to do so. Their is no contact number for help. We can only CHAT with them. And I waited for half an hour but go no response in the chat window. This app sucks,1

2021,"Since the day after I ordered the stuff it's saying the items are being prepared.... When asked for help in chat, they repeated the same thing.

I didn't figure it out until two days later when i checked on the status. Contacted zara, they said ""it was sent to the address it was sent to."" Then ceased conversation! Like literally no goodbye, just ""hung up"" lol! I have the screenshot. Thankfully, I went to the address and they returned my items. This app sucks, don't use it. Zara sucks for too.",1
2021,I had good experience at the beginning when I installed the app but later it started hanging and taking endless time to download images. At the end it wasn't recognising my email so I couldn't log in nor place any purchase order,2

2021,Can't use the text boxes to register!?!,1
2021,I much prefer shopping on the website. 2 main reasons: 1. I was unable to finalise at checkout. 2. Items appeared out of stock in the app while I was still able to purchase them on the website,1
2021,Terrible app. I tried to reset my password but did not receive the promised email. I tried to add an in-stock item to the basket and was told it was out of stock. Each time I open the app it says connection has failed even though I am on (functioning) mobile data.,1
2021,I guess they have 2 items in stock. 10 out 10 times they started the biggest sales unprepared.,1
2021,"Terrible. It doesn't work without giving it access to your location, hungs while registering and it lets you add items that are immediately after shown as out of stock in the checkout.",1
2021,I and many other people do online shopping from website. I understand the strategy behind pushing the people to download app. However this is very stupid and unnecessary step because everyone will delete it again when the sale is over! Website is closed to shopping and we're not able to log in app and there is no customer service after that. I already found an alternative brand Jack& Jones! Better quality reasonable price. Marketing team should resign or kicked out after this foolishness.,1

Pls provide an email address for us to contact you!",1
2021,"The models all look amazing and beautiful and thank you for the representation in race. Is there a specific reason they're all skinny though, is your target market that specific body type? Because it would be great if you could also have representation in body shapes as well especially since we can't simply walk into stores and fit the clothing anymore due to covid. It would make the online shopping experience easier. So please consider it.",1
2021,Good product,5
2021,Always hanging and very slow to respond,1

2021,Getting worse with every update,2
2021,"Terrible, cannot pay for my order.....",1
2021,Why are the models moody angry ambivalent n in your face n oversexualized? It's like no.one allowed to be down to earth n innocent anymore. It really puts me off the clothes n is distracting. I dont want to be anything like them. If it was just the clothing. I'd give you 5 stars. Really wide interesting selection. But I wont buy anything cause I feel I'd be in coersion representing women like that. Vomitous.,1
2021,This is the worst app to navigate. It won't let me see all my purchases. The way the models are modeling you can see the for of the clothes. I love Zara. Just not the app,1

2021,This app is good but the issue comes when you have some problem with the order is far more complicated to resolve compared to the store. In the store have more options and have more sense and are more concerned about your problem.,1

2021,They haven't refunded my money as yet. It's veen more that 12 days. And there customer service team sucks big time. They just don't give a damn.

2021,Good,4
2021,I have a lot of problem..its not easy to reach customer care and the refund option is very difficult,2
2021,"I have orders indicate that they have shipped, weeks go by and the order never makes it to delivery point.

2021,Well balanced and clean interface. Premiumness in every aspect the quality of every single product is up to the mark and it's interface is not like other cheap Indian shopping website. Must go. No ads too.,5
2021,Worst return policy! Had items sent to me by my sister as a gift and I couldn't return or exchange for anything in store because I didn't have a gift receipt. Items were current and less than 30 days from date of purchase. Items are useless now because they are too small for my baby. Very disappointed!,1

2021,"Can't say much about the app, my question is why is SA ZARA stops at XL for majority of their items...and not XXL yhuuu ha.a",1

2021,"Was a very good app until the latest update and now I'm unable to open any of my saved favourites. I can see them but can't access them individually so to order them I will now have to search for them again in main menu. I only have about 10 items saved so it's not that i5 have too many. Cleared cache, data and uninstalled and installed again but still not able to access",1
2021,What is the point of having a favorites option if you can't actually click on the items in your favorites to order? They are just there to look at...how dumb,1

2021,I am unable to track my order and later I hv come to know that my order was cancelled without any notification. I was told to place the order again and then again I could track it after a few days I contacted them just to know that it has been cancelled again. I don't know what the hell is happening with them. The chat gets over again and again and everytime there is new person so I had to tell them the same thing again and again. Very poor customer dealing. Horrible experience!,1

2021,I set up an email notification for a bag that I wanted but was out of stock. Immediately after receiving the notification that the bag was available I went to the app with the intention of purchasing it only to find that it was out of stock AGAIN. It was probably sold out during the day since I received the notification late afternoon.

I gave three stars because the app sometimes feel like a basic wish list of items for me. I would love for the opportunity to be alerted, when my favoured item(s) is low in stock (including the amount left). It would be awesome if sales, new items in store etc. from the app is also linked back to my email or text messages sent to phone (provided as an option to consumers).",3
2021,Why don't you guys improve your app Worst refund and customer service . I mean like I have been struggling to get the refund for more than 3 weeks still got delivered in the wrong account.

For example, I wanted to check which payment method I used on a recent purchase, and it's just nowhere. Not listed ANYWHERE. Not when I download the e-ticket, not when I check my purchase history, nowhere. Half the error messages you get (""offline, try again"") turn out to be BS.

2021,"I like Zara, but HATE the app and the way they display the items. You just don't know what's for sale and what's just a random photo. It's complicated to just look at the products you want to see. Often items are shown in black & white, and while I'm sure this is intended to be 'styleised', it's just frustrating. Display the items simply, so it's easy to scroll through and see what you want to buy! I've stopped buying from Zara on the app and online because it's just a frustrating experience.",1
2021,Zara stole my money... they made 2 transactions but I only bought 1 item... then they're delivery is over 2 weeks late. Not impressed at all.,1
2021,I been a fan and shopping here since 2006,5
2021,It is not use friendly. Does not give you the size measurement for the item. How you supposed to purchase without knowing.,1
2021,I can't even log in and I can't put anything in my basket...really bad! I'd like to buy but the app won't let me!,1
2021,Very good,5
2021,Great,5
2021,Deliveries take time more than the estimated date,1
2021,Not able to make payment through card on your app. Shows error all the time.,1
2021,I ordered with express shipping thru app while processing the app changes the shipping to snail shipping and on the delivery day I get emails that the order is coming the next day. This is the 4th day the delivery is late. I am cancelling the cc payment tomorrow and not accepting delivery. This customer service is atrocious,1
2021,"Since it is not available for huawai, it was working yesterday ü§®",1

2021,Items from my favorite gets randomly deleted all of the sudden every other day. It's very annoying. It needs to be fixed.,3
2021,Annoying because it let's me put items in the basket but they're not really there on the site and can't check them out!,3
2021,"Zara is running a big time scam by not refunding the money even after 2 months of product return. Their customer service is pathetic, the representatives don't have any manners, their chats are not saved, there is no help from anyone from Zara.",1
2021,Ok,3
2021,Very slow in uploading data but top stars for all the rest,4

2021,Brilliant,5
2021,absolutley sh!te. how are you supposed to navigate around to shop for clothes?? all i find is childrens faces smiling? i bet theres loads of clothes that can be sold BUT WE JUST CANT SEE THEM!! sales would boost if you sorted this app so its straight forward enough to actually see the clothes. and tell your models to stand up straight its off putting.,1
2021,Not for mans,1
2021,There is no Indian option,1
2021,Customer service is very very bad. They never have any answer to ur queries. They delay reponses.,2
2021,I'm not even able to register myself and start the app,1
2021,I adore Zara since moving I need app I rather wait n drive I'm a personal Stylist.Worst app I'm in design and fashion business. I tried so many times you never know if you put in basket most times have to go back and changethe amount of pieces. It also hard to change size when shopping for clients. I used other means. What really Sucks I get to end cash out half not in . Stuff in sale in All Sizes out of stock but shows to buy Do a American one and UK if we shop different I don't know demograph,1
2021,its difficult to use .. minimal equalls to none information,1
2021,Awesome,5

2021,Worst app. . Order is delivered so late you'll get old. Please don't waste your time and money here.,1
2021,Incredibly difficult to navigate. Just go to the store.,1
2021,App crashing all the time!,1
2021,"The chat is awful. I wanted to return one of the clothes bought through this app because it wasn't like on the picture, but as their store is closed in my area, they said only home return is possible through their app or website. I already did 3 times and everytime it shows a courier incident. So whatever you buy from Zara online, be careful it won't be possible to return later",1
2021,"Payment options are not intuitive. If you have to back out of a payment option the shopping bag (cart) deletes all of the merchandise. Once the payment method is completed, acknowledgment of payment is not forthcoming, leaving the customer unsure of the transaction.",1

2021,Super basic app,1
2021,"Absolutely horrible. I made a prepaid order that never got delivered to me. They delivered it somewhere else (within two days for placing the order) and on complaining they sent me an invoice with a signature that was not even mine. I placed another order, a COD this time and it's been a week and they had not even shipped it. It's pathetic and the management is so incompetent. I neither received a refund for my previous order nor my package.",1
2021,Zara on shopee please!,5
2021,Mala. No permite seleccionar talles. Solamente pude una vez luego de actualizarla. Luego el error se repiti√≥ a pesar de volver a actualizarla. Desastrosa,1
2021,Earlier when I used to open this app I used to spend more time browsing through all the designs and see the new collection ...selection process was way more easier and it was quite user friendly.... I am not sure anymore...it looks way more confusing now with so many category options and too many layout changes and the actual shopping ease and experience is lost ...the old basic and simple minimalist zara was way more cooler.üòî,3
2021,"The app constantly crashes, i can't log in, add anything to my basket or see my prev purchase details. Its so frutrating. I've uninstalled & installed as advised by cs several times..made no difference!!",1

2021,Nice,5
2021,"I would advise anyone using this app to enter with a compass, a sextant, and a sherpa to find a single article of clothing. The app is pretty, sleek, and modern but feels like you're treking through mud mentally.",1
2021,The app is horrible as fas as contacting the executive is concerned. The chat just closeson it's own while we await reply from them. And then we have to restart all over again. Plus the contact phone number is out of order for the last 6 months at least. Poor professionalism,4

2021,Nice app,5
2021,Excellent,4
2021,Twice they have removed items from my orders and easily just told me it was out of stock. It's a shame that such a big brand couldn't manage its site to make items unavailable before buying!!!

2021,"It's a good app with decent discounts but some basic things are amiss: #1 The refunds take ages #2 you cannot add a product to your wishlist from your purchases section neither can you view whether it's available in another size or not #3 they don't tell you the models height and the size of the garment they're wearing, which is a given nowadays. #4 What is up with the pant lengths? Nearly all legwear is short for me even at maximum size (I'm 6'2"") If they rectify these, the brand's pretty cool",3
2021,"The chat doesn't work at all,the customer service sucks!they doesn't reply at all when my package of 71 dollars order lost.I would never buy neither recommend zara again!!!!the order showed delivered but never arrived!they do nothing!neither refund nor replacement!never buy Zara!",1
2021,Good,4
2021,I made a purchase and it said the items would be sent within 1 week. I waited for more than a month for them to be delivered. It never came. Then it was cancelled without giving me any notice beforehand after more than 5 weeks. Customer Service kept changing their responses when given inquiries as to the order.

2021,"Everytime Zara Egypt launches a sale, you can never purchase an item because sizes are removed. Also, certain items can never be purchased online, they tell you item does not exist in here then, you go to the shop and they have it. It's like they do not have control over the merchandise. And, pretend to call directly to the shop? Forget it, they rarely pick up the phone. In general, the appilcation in this country is terrible!",2

2021,Always face problem and frod against return,1
2021,My packages got cancelled twice because of faulty coding in the app. They also made a mistake in inventory and I did not get all the products that I ordered. On top of that I called to inquire about the mistake and they only excuse was ' well it was a mistake' no apologies or any way to compensate their mistakes. My package has yet to arrive. The worst customer service and their is a total lack of actual SERVICE done.,1
2021,Worst app ever. So i ordered a skirt from zara on 25 th dec and now it's 15 feb. I don't even remember how many times I have called zara. But they ain't doing a thing about it. Don't order from zara. They don't give your money back if you return something. Worst customer service ever.,1

2021,I made a mistake while ordering 3 products from Zara. So I called them up and asked them to cancel it and refund the money since I paid through Google pay. This happened December 2020 and till now I haven't received my money. I trusted Zara thinking that its international and will be professional. But it was so useless I have been calling them since last 3 week still no response all they say is I understand and it's a technical issue. Like how many weeks do they need to fix that technical issue?,1

2021,"I love Zara clothes however I find the sizes inconsistent and there are no reviews or indicators to say whether an item is true to size, comes up large or small. Also there are limited sometimes badly posed photos where the model is sitting/lying down so it can be difficult to gauge the clothes so sometimes I love an item but get the size wrong.",3
2021,The sale items difficult to know whitch are still available. Also sometimes the model too much acting and we cannot see the items clearly.,3

2021,My order is so late,1
2021,The art director for the app needs to be shot or hung the way this app flows is HORRIBLE why am I looking at the same items in after scrolling past them ? There is no organization in this app. If your looking at a blue button down shirt and it comes in multiple colors and then scroll across to other styles of shirts after maybe 4 swipes you will come across the same blue button down shirt but its in brown instead. Just have all color next to each other when you scroll. Terrible app flow.,2

2021,Love the Clothes a lot,5
2021,"Browsing and shopping is easy. No reviews are posted. Returns information is not great. No summary of how much you'll get back, very minimal information. Also the tracking is super weird. I sent back 5 boxes and FedEx is only showing 1. I hope this works out!",2
2021,Zara is a disgrace when it comes to online shopping. It allows you to put items in your basket and when you ho checkout items is out of stock or when you to to pay now it tells you items are out of stock whole processing payment. Zara should allow items to be in your basket for at least 30 minutes while you look at other items to purchase. I should really go to the newspapers with this.,1
2021,I cannot pay everytime I go to checkout the payment method won't load I made sure it's up to date and tried website instead of the app but still won't load!,1
2021,"Really easy to use and site is set out well. The fun starts when you select a size add it to your basket, go to buy iy and it's not available. Definitely not a one off, happens all the time! Never happened before, wasting my time especially since we can't go to shops right now, so relying on online purchases!",3
2021,Click and collect information is not available it may take up to couple of weeks for items to be delivered in shop to be collected it is absolutely annoying.,1

2021,My experience in getting refund back from Zara inditex is the WORST. waiting for my refund from November 2020. They don't provide any phone no. for complaint in India and even they don't provide any email so that we can complaint through that. Only live chat is available and their corrospondents don't satisfy a single querry of you.Totally mere wastage.That 's why i'm sharing that you will face problems in refund. So shop on your own risk.,1
2021,It's absolutely shame suche good made stuff should sale like this! most products are different comper to standard sizes and there's no clear description special when you can't try them on. I have orders ¬£1000 and all trousers were short!! For how many years you want to make short trousers?,1

2021,"Since the last update, can't use the app",1
2021,"Poor. Size guides font load and have errors. The menu and home page are not intuitive. The photos are taken more for visual appeal rather than to showcase the item, how it sits, what it looks like on and off models so its very hard to get a sense of the product.",2

If an item is in my basket it should be made unavailable to anyone else until I confirm payment. If I had it in my hand in a shop you wouldn't allow someone to come and take it off me!,2

I don't want to shop anymore because its a waist of time to choose something is available but after 5 minutes no availability. Why other shop save your clothes in the basket for at least one hour.

I don't even know how this could happen. Thankfully, Zara has a good customer service in Japan. So I think they will let me exchange these for the right size (I had a similar problem before).

When accessing /logging in asking for location, after having placed products in the shopping basket upon checking out most items are ""not available in your region"".

I got no refund so a stranger is in possession of my parcel.,1
2021,I honestly don't think this app is catered to people on their phone. The user experience is absolutely horrible. Bookmarked items don't appear unless you click on the item and go into it's page - if you try bookmark while scrolling through items it won't save. I also tried to contact someone regarding a return and I cant send my message on the 24 hour chat because the send has been grayed out. They chat text input box also seems delayed.

2021,"The only thing I would change is to enable users to add more items to the shopping bag that hasn't been prepared yet. So, if I buy a shirt and want to buy another one a couple of hours later with the bag not being prepared, I can add the next one and get them in the same package.",5

2021,Will never shop here ever again! I didn't recieve updates on the status of my order until two days before it arrived (after I asked them about it of course). Then they attempted to withdraw the money from my account twice(luckily that account was empty). After reading reviews I thought I'd never recieve my order.,1

2020,Nice app,5
2020,Horrible service and app,1
2020,They do not restock their items during sale . I saw that before sale timings also 50 percent items were out of stock and when I contacted them they ignored it.,1
2020,Very quick delivery..less than the time expected and mentioned on the app..Genuine products and quite easy to use the app which is far better than standing in the long que.,5
2020,Highly recommend,5
2020,"This app works only for checking one item, for next links it shows nothing and must exit and try again and again.",1

2020,"Had the worst experience shopping with zara app. Raised a request for the return of product. Nobody came for return pickup. You can waste all the time with customer care, they just tell you to wait for 3-5 days. 15 days have passed now. No resolution.",1
2020,Very disappointing. Item put in your basket disappear straight away during sales. Give customers atleast 30 mins before removing the items from their baskets.,2
2020,poor customer service.,1
2020,Worst payment system. And no returns,1
2020,"The app won't allow me to save my credit or debit card info. So I have to reenter every time. And when it is during sale, then I am wasting time on it while the stuff is all gone. Also, when items in my cart are out of stock, it won't automatically take them out. I gotta go back and remove them myself and go back to payment. By that time, the card info i entered is lost again. So its a nightmare",3

2020,"From a brand like Zara one expects better. The app is very poorly conceptualized with basic features like Cancelling an order, deleting an old saved address missing from it. When brands choose to have their own app and not sell it on 3rd party platforms like Myntra, they should atleast design apps that are equally good if not better. Pathetic experience using the Zara app.",1
2020,Can't login,1
2020,Won't let you search for a specific item. Very frustrating!!,2
2020,"I don't received what I order, instead I got wrong product, when I complained about wrong products they don't want to pick up wrong product and no refund, in the first place its zara mistake that they packed wrong items. Its very easy to put up an order but when we got the wrong items it's so difficult to return the item. So from my point of view online shopping is a kinda fraud , now I will file against zara to consumer complaint .",1
2020,"User friendly, Return process is so easy also via this app. I have been using it for 7 times purchased. The quality of the picture is clear, the description of the material also clear. The administration behind this app can be seen working a very good job üëçüëç Satisfied customer",5

You add an item to your bag which is clearly in stock, go to your bag and it's marked as out of stock, go back to the item and it says its in stock again. Incredibly frustrating as you have to go round and round in circles on the app and can't even end up buying anything. Also the search results are clearly broken as you can't scroll the full results.",2

Zara claims that the parcel has been delivered even though nobody signed for the package because couriers self-sign due to covid, and refused the refund or store credit.

2020,I like the ease of scanning the barcodes of the clothes i like in the store then being able to bookmark them in the app. I just wish they didn't sell out of practically everything when they have a sale. Because I'm never able to get the items i want when i see it finally discounted.,5

2020,Zara has payment gateway issues never got my refund . I placed an order two months ago and zara uses CITRUS payment solutions in india which is duping people of their money. A simple process like refund should happen automatically . Because of zara using citrus pay they hold on to people's money . Plus reaching out to zara using chat and calls is also hard . No one replies in chats. And they do not have an email facility. This is one of the biggest retail chains and they don't have email !lol,1

2020,Nothing is secure in your cart. It's literally sold out while your shopping. I put items in and go to checkout and items are sold out. How is that possible when it was available and in my cart (smh). This bugged should be fixed. I shouldn't have to rush to purchase so things do get taken out of my cart while shopping. This is just silly if you ask me. Zara should wait until the buyer is finished purchase to put the item back into the system as item available.,1

And on 4th December I get a mail that my order has been cancelled due to lack of availablity. I had been looking at the same product daily and my size had always been available. Why did you guys accept my order if you had no intention to deliver it. Pathetic customer service.,1
2020,"It's been very annoying which is sad to say, I had returned a product and haven't received my refund, it's been a month now. The customer care services are beyond poor, no one replies on the chat and the telephone service are worthless, even if they reply or answer the call no action has been taken whatsoever.

I don't even have the product, it is at their store and I don't want it I wanna cancel the order and they're taking so long just to discuss the case. I mean what is there to discuss!!??

So while on one hand payment was debited, it was not recognised by the app. Worse is there is no support available for these issues. It only has chat option but no time mentioned. One gets the impression it's 24x7 so you keep wasting time trying and don't get any response. Nit even a chat bot to inform that it is outside serviceable hours. Really bad experience of shopping on the app",1

2020,I have complains.(1) I can't see the sizing guide for size 4. (2) When I finallize an order it does not ask me which address to send the order to and that's HIGHLY inconvenient ; you don't even know which address it's going to until you have placed the order(3)Also the tracking service is of no use. It just informs you when it has shipped and been sent to the courier(4) when the order has been cancelled it doesn't reflect on your purchases screen(5) zara doesnt refund the shipping charges,2
2020,I love Zara so much but you guys stopped giving home delivery now. Please solve this problem asap,2

2020,This app is just worst. They can't deliver on time when you order something and when you inquire you only get same answer everyday. And don't address your issues properly. They might be cheating because I ordered a top and I don't get it delivered till today. Worst shopping experience ever,1

2020,I got triple debited for a transaction and when querying it with them they tell me to speak to my bank. They refuse to help me. Don't shop on their website or their app. It's not secure,1
2020,"I love Zara, but this app is pain. It's not easy to navigate, and once you are ready to checkout, the items are out of stock. Please fix it and make our shopping experience easier.",3
2020,Good,5
2020,Shipping prices are extremely high almost 300 rupees,4
2020,"App is not user friendly. If you really want to buy zara, better go to some store.",1
2020,"The app itself is well designed and is a nice experience of browsing. The service around purchasing however is terrible. I made a purchase over 2 weeks ago and am still waiting for my order to be dispatched (not even to arrive!!!). The only communication from the retailer was 1 time stating that there will be a delay, with no reason why or formal apology.",1
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Ok,5
2020,Fab clothes but horrible return policy and slow delivery so the 3 stars,3
2020,"if there is even a negative star for the kind of customer service I got from the online shop regarding the mistake they had on delivering totally wrong item to me from what I ordered. they kept of delaying and giving me a vague answer. the order i did is time-sensitive, hence, i made sure it arrives just before I needed it because I planned to give it as a gift. but no, because of them, i am so inconvenienced and the customer service just kept on ignoring me. totally unacceptable!!!",1

2020,Not recommended at all. Sy pesan lewat Zara Indonesia dan mengajukan refund.. dlm 1 hari barang di pick up tapi sudah 1 bulan lebih refund belum dibayarkan,1
2020,Extremely hard to navigate their website and also their app. I'm not interested in seeing models in artistic poses. I just want to look at the article of clothing. Can't they pose in traditional poses? I'm not interested in seeing close face ups or them upside down. I am a customer and was trying to find a shirt that I liked in store but could not find it. Their website is terrible and hard to navigate and their app is even worse.,1

2020,Cannot find anything Weird scroll on the products,1
2020,No women's cologne product on this app,1
2020,Cancelled an order on zara a month ago and still haven't received the refund. The customer service does not even care about sending any confirmation of refund initiation. Worst experience i ever had.,1
2020,You cannot generate returns from the app. You have to log in to Zara's full site on Google to generate your returns for a QR code. I thought the whole point of an app is to make things much easier for the user?,1
2020,Does not remember my log in details and will not send an email to reset password,1

2020,"Horrible, try to get to my recent purchases and only show last years purchases.",1
2020,"It has pathetic customer service . nobody is there to solve your query .I opted for return request ,the came the same day to take away the parcel but taking so long to refund and when asked they just gag out their same crammed sentences so you need to do something about your services and my refund.",3

2020,"I did not find the app (online) experience good. They do not take returns and refunds seriously when you cancel an order. They did not return my money (the amount was huge), even after several complaints. So beware. The customer service is pathetic, you get same system generated replies. Customer is not valued, does not get any help at all.",1

2020,üòé,5
2020,The worst. I ordered seven items on the app. They never got delivered. The tracker shows when I made the purchase. However they were never sent. I called their customer care line nothing was resolved. Kept being put on hold. I have wasted my time and money on this nonsense. Can't recommend.,1
2020,Payment not proceed,1
2020,Easy to use and they also accept COP. üòä,5
2020,Doesn't work,1
2020,"App lets you save items classified as 'buy later', but you can never erase those items if they become out of stock. :-/ Also, delivery takes at least 2 weeks, with follow up. Home pick up for returns takes almost a moth (with 2 follow ups). So stressful! ‚òπ",1
2020,So expensive,1
2020,Horrible experience. ZARACHAT feature is useless. If there is network issue they will end up the chat own there own without resolving the issue. And again and again new helping desk pops up and asking for whole issue again and again. TOTALLY USELESS.,1

2020,great experienced! however they could have improve their sales. they would out something on sale but they are actually not available.,5
2020,"Things are gone from my shopping bag while i'm shopping ,apparently all the data about available things are not up to date in every moment which is very dissapointing. There should also be some limited amount of time for the things that we put in our shopping bag. If you exit the app, your bag is empy! All in all , not working so well.",2
2020,"Just open my item from Zara's I've been a long time shopper at the many stores they have and have LOVE IT and I've just done online shopping with them excellent service had it delivered to a store of my choice was kept informedon delivery,arrived on time, collected no problem ,well packaged item undamaged ..... well pleased ..

2020,The app has a lot of improvements to make when it comes to the chat options. It's not very helpful with resolving issues and they need to do some more testing with keys phrases customer may use to resolve an issue. Also you have to go thru to many windows or clicks to figure out your package status which the app does not do a great job of showing the most updated information. Very disappointing as I have been order and shopping at Zara for years.,2

In the era of online shopping such pathetic online experience makes you irritate.",1
2020,Your Devloper team need to spend some time on Ur App and fix the bug. It doesn't even open the first page forget about shoping. Really disgusting app. I don't even feel like giving any rating. It doesn't even deserve a star but to post this review I have to click on a star.,1
2020,"Seems there's problem after your last release...we found product available while browsing and once we click on cart for payment it's showing ""No longer available"". I have reported this issue since last week but as usual no corrective action from your support desk therefore down grading rating now. Please check my emails and tweets as well. Atleast acknowledge and show some courtesy. You're leading brand of ""Inditex"" and we're not accepting this from you.",1
2020,1.)The size of garment that model is wearing should be mentioned while showing the product. 2.)There another issue that this app doesn't support the UPIM/GPAY/PHONEPE payments even though the payment options are available. 3.) The products which are out of stock are still shown for selection and once you add it in card and go to the cart it shows item is no longer available. 4.) This is one of the biggest issue I've faced that the same product can be seen with two different prices. FIX THESE,1

The app is available in English even if you're ordering in Turkey and that's what I like the most about it. I recommend for sure and love using this app just for the packaging that I have not seen in other brands.",5
2020,I am facing issue with COD. It automatically cancel my order if i place anything...,1
2020,"App UI is good. When contacted fo help via chat nobody responds at all and I waited there for 4-5mins idle. And they ended the chat. And when called, the person on the other end had no idea and just said one thing as he would escalate this issue to the concerned team and I would be getting a call from supervisor within 24-48 hours and it's.more than 80hrs now.. nobody contacted me and nobody is aware of my order status.. pathetic customer service.!! Juts having good stuff isn't good üò°",1
2020,Zero üåü. Because: The tracking mechanism in the app doesn't work. Fire your tech guys and hire new one. And your email customer service is also faulty. Gives wrong and self contradictory replies.,1

2020,My favourite shop,5
2020,Osm appüòá,5
2020,Zara immediately need to take steps.There are lot of issues with the app. 1.Sometimes your product dose not get delivered to you. 2.some the items showing out if stock after putting it to the bag. 3. The hepl centre is not at all helpful.,1
2020,The layout and everything and the sorting options are just not upto the mark.. Sometimes it's frustrating.. This app needs a lot of changes,2
2020,"First time shopping on this app - half my orders got cancelled without ANY communication from customer care. I got emails saying ""your return request has been accepted"" when I have NEVER placed any request to return my order. They messed up on their end and are now trying to put the blame on the customer. There's no customer service available either, so now I'm stuck. Please please just rely on Myntra/Amazon/Nykaa etc. instead. This is NOT a reliable app, especially for such expensive products.",1

2020,"Chat function is the worst, you are chatting with robots who can never help with anything but an apology. I'm still waiting for an order made on 23 April. Worst shopping app I've ever used.",1

2020,Great apps,5
2020,Premium product at an affordable prize,5
2020,Experience is not seamless poor design needs lots of improvement,3
2020,"Horrible experience. After purchasing the items, they delayed the shipment till the time they acknowledged that ""items are out of stock"", i believe they are far from Zara institution in Europe... Make your self a favor visit a shop or you'll just waste your money...",1
2020,they should write the size the model is wearing.,3
2020,Never buy in this app...they never deliver on time and it's been two weeks after.palcing the order am running pillar to pillar to get the product and pathetic support,1

2020,i ordered 3 shirts 11 days ago n it hasnt arrived yet.. nobody is replying to my email and nobody answering the call in stores.. theres no update on my order on the app.. not even yet ready to send.. it still says preparing!!! horrible experience,2
2020,good,4
2020,Very very very bad.. Unsatisfied with the online services provided by Zara from 19 june 2020 i have ordered and today is 30 june not yet received and the expected delivery date was on 24 june 2020 the status is showing being prepared until when???,1
2020,"Don't know if it's the app, or the order department but my orders keep getting cancelled. It's annoying, so much for having an app for easier shopping..",1
2020,Delivery experience was ridiculous. The costumer support is damn slow to act upon issues caused to costumer. I regret choosing zara online. Worst service.,1
2020,Not deliver my parcel,1
2020,Fantastic,5
2020,Awesome,5
2020,"The Zara chat feature is horrible. There is no form of accountability but just preprogrammed bot responses that don't address your questions or problems. Further on the app merges orders from two completely different dates and this prevents you from cancelling a specific order and you end up with things you don't want. My conclusion is that Zarachat isn't helpful, Zara needs a direct line where I can resolve issues that I know can be easily resolved via a phone call with a person.",1
2020,Worst experience.. they will never deliver your product ..and keep your money for weeks .. don't buy online with them,1
2020,It is having very few varieties of clothes,1

2020,"Hey you guys, I've purchased a skinny joggers first of all it was not 1/4th of what it seemed in the picture like colour wise. And after when I got it, the quality seem good at First but shortly after the threads started to come off, had enormous expectations but it turns out these top-end brands are not all good. Probably my first and last item from this 'outlet'.",1
2020,Awesome,5

2020,Very nice,5
2020,Very good company,5
2020,I don't get any update on goods purchased. The app does not show where is your parcel or whether it is in tramsit or stuck somewhere. Also the customer service is so disgusting and disrespect they don't correct any information after placing order and ask you to purchase something else,2

2020,"What'a the point of this app if all the sizes of all the items are marked ""coming soon""??",1
2020,It's very good,5
2020,Customer servicenya lousy worst ever! Di email jawabannya dicopy paste doang dan ga dijawab samasekali pertanyaannya. How can zara trained customer service as stupid as pig? and no respect at all.. i emailed 3 times and what i got was responsed just like robot without giving me answer. just copy paste and repeating the same answered. didnt even answered what i was asking. at the end just put no respect to me and saying the same stupid things without really put on concern of what im asking!!,1
2020,User interface is not good at all. Payment gets stuck,1

2020,Nice,5
2020,"Easy and efficient app. Great that I can use it in English in Korea unlike other retailers like H&M. The app is so easy to use with payment apps like Payco. And has cute functions like saving the order confirmation as picture in your gallery. Best of all is the easy return process! Unlike other retailers (yes, H&M, I'm referring to you again) Good job Zara!",5
2020,"Tried to chat with the CS, and everytime, the chat was onesidedly closed with the caption ""we detected you've been inactive for a while"" Meanwhile i was writing the mssg. That's super confusing.",1
2020,Really like the app and company policy.,5
2020,Rubbish,1
2020,The app works fine but Zara online shopping is a nightmare. It took them a week to debit my account for my purchases then 3 weeks to receive my order. And then I submitted the return form which has no option for exchange items and I sent them a chat no feedback email has an automated response it's terrible shopping on the app I must day,2
2020,"The experience is very pleasent with the app so far though you need sometime to get used to it but the app is very organized and elegant. There is just two things I'd like to suggest for a change. 1. Please bring an option to cancel orders, there isn't any by chance if we want to cancel it we have to wait for it to arrive and deny delivery or return and ask refund both are a hassle. 2. The size chart needs to be less cluttered and please add inseame for trousers, joggers and jeans.",4
2020,It's totally waste and these guys are rejecting the order and if I'm asking the customer service they're not responding well,1
2020,Very poor,1
2020,"I love the app. The only thing is availability of what you like in your size, especially bigger sizes.",4
2020,This is a wonderful app,5
2020,Good product . I also impressed thos products . Tq,5
2020,Verry good ahoping,4
2020,The app is horrible. Not user friendly at all. The chat function sucks. You are basically talking to robots. Don't purchase on the app because you have to accept terms. The terms WILL share your information so use the app only for a shopping guide. The help desk doesn't help because they cannot even tell you how to view your card information. Just don't.,1
2020,Store Availability is not accurate. Purchase through app is the worst experience! No coordination with customer esp when delivering with the item. Nice goods but service is Not recommended!,2
2020,"Paying the extra amount to receive the orders faster is as slow as the default way. And on top of this, zara won't give you the money back for choosing the fast delivery method so if you're in a rush to get something from Zara, go buy it in the store. A bit disappointing...",2
2020,No option to query orders!!! Left stranded,2
2020,"Whoever designed Zara's website and app did an amazing job. I don't think any shopping app's interface compares. Super user-friendly, always a seamless experience. Whoever quality controlled this product did an amazing job. The weird things I notice lol!",5
2020,Awesome,5
2020,Best,5
2020,its not a accurate it's not helpful don't offer much help for the sizes option to be change some of your clothes size fit smaller,3

2020,I think items should have a wait time when you place them in your cart,1
2020,I am giving this app due to pricing and difficulty of the shopping experience. You can not Google the name Zara clothing just to see items you physically have to get the app which i think its stupid unless you like this store overall. I believe your prices are a bit over priced but hey I get it I work in retail myself so I know ok.. I understand what people think about this store with low ratings. Perhaps read their suggestions and make your app a little bit easier to use please.,1
2020,Worst models. They make the clothes look bad.,1
2020,Most off the items are not available then why they are on the app just put the available ones plz,1
2020,Does not ship to Nigeria,1
2020,Easy to use,5
2020,Love this app,5
2020,Best way to shop,5
2020,You always have no sizes from almost all of the products on the app.. when u announce a sale we go check but also no sizes! So why to have this app since i can't buy through it!!,1
2020,"Great user experience - kudos to the designers, project managers, and developers.",5
2020,Good,5
2020,"Is not intuitive or user friendly, doesn't allow you to add bank card details or status updates are completely irrelevant and really doesn't hold Zara accountable for a great customer experience. You are not able to rely on any status update or lack thereof. There is no flow or checkout basket that makes sense and the delivery date is vague to say the least. From time you order it tells you that delivery date is anything from 5 days after the order to an additional 7 days is when you may get it",1
2020,Being a such big brand.. I expect the app to be user friendly.. It's quite inconvenience to use compare to other app.,1
2020,I love it,5
2020,"Gets locked or program shuts itself often...when will you fix this problem I wonder... Such a pity my shopping gets blocked each time, still persistently I buy but this is so unfair and irritating for your users, one might easily give up and delete the app and not buy.. It's like you are testing us, so annoying shopping experience... üòî",2
2020,Love it!!!,5
2020,"Great App but giving 4 stars instead of 5, because of the shopping experience. The items were disappearing constantly from my basket, as soon as they were put in. Please can you allow time for people to browse, before they pay, so its a more enjoyable less stressful experience, and gives everyone a chance to purchase what they want. üòä Thanks",4
2020,"App is great in terms of its presentation and userfriendly nature, the quality of images and overall UI is really good. I just had one issue with it though , track your delivery link doesn't work from placed order section, you might wanna look into it.",4

2020,"I had ordered Zara seoul summer perfume in March 2020. However i received the regular Zara Seoul. So i requested for exchange, the perfume was sent back to them and its been more than three months no come back or update Zara. Customer service always ask me to wait. Never buy from Zara again. Its been 3 months now Zara has not replaced my product to me nor they are giving my money back.",1
2020,Excellent experience üëå highly recommended.,5
2020,"The app isn't good , after I checkout it won't authenticate my payment",1
2020,The app is good with large variety. I am facing an issue with the payment from a few months. I tried with many cards from different banks but of no use. Hope you rectify it soon or provide us with other alternatives. Waiting so badly to order some clothes for my little one. Even though I like many items I am just backing out because of the payment.,2

2020,Is very interesting,5
2020,"Terrible app, along with a terrible website. The awful system of entering addresses meant my order was sent to wrong address and Zara will not do anything about it. Will not shop with Zara online or via this app again",1

2020,"Service client indisponible, j'arrive pas √† annuler des commandes depuis 24hrs Je recommande pas",1
2020,The mobile app is really a pain when it comes to the customer care/help section. The chat automatically disables after every 5-10 seconds even when you're typing. The bug needs to be fixed. The check in availability feature seems to be disabled almost all the time. there's no way you can access multiple options for a particular product item. UI is fancy but the UX part just sucks.,2
2020,Worst app ever. You can type while registering yourself.,1
2020,"Zara shopping is a NIGHTMARE. App crashes and lags most of the time. Customer service is terrible. Shipping is worst, as well as delivery because not one order ever reached me.",1

2020,SUPERB AAAAA +++++,5
2020,"Reviw for Zara INDONESIA: The app is responsive, although lacks for sorting feature (only filters). BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS: Zara not only delays shipping of otherwise short trip (Jakarta to any Javanese cities won't take >3 days), but also CHOOSES the slowest, clumsiest and most unreliable shipping partner: JNE. It's just exacerbating the problem, first you took one week to prepare the order, and one MORE week to let JNE deliver the otherwise 2-day worth of shipping!! Choose other expeditions.",2
2020,"Really straight forward easy and quick app. Whatever problems people were having before it appears to be fixed. I've use during a flash sale, it didn't crash or slowed down. And I can finally save my favourite item and wait until it goes on sale!!",5
2020,Not a great use experience - lots of bugs in simple things such as tracking delivery. Not useful for a user,2
2020,Horrible to navigate,1

2020,I love ZARA but .. while paying a big amount on debit card and UPI it declines payment most of the time. Make sure you work on it. Rest is fine. Live for the app. Have had faced no issues with their items so far! A happy client! Also please introduce paytm for fast payment.,3

2020,"ZARA has always been specifically my favourite app. For online shopping and merchandising, this not only gives me immense list of products to go through but also aware me about the latest fashion trends globally. This makes me feel more deprived towards the app features and it's fashion sense. Categorising fashion on the basis of gender and looks is a great step towards fashion forecast.

2020,Love it,5
2020,It is very nice and I love it so ooooo much,5
2020,First of all the app does not offer the option of selecting a region of Bosnia and Herzegovina which has its own language and it is a separate country yet when you choose the region of some other country you can select the Bosnia but only in Croatian which is another country and the language spoken there and English so once you select one of those it just crashes and then you have nothing so even though no that's quite good business in Bosnia it seems they only speak one language.,1
2020,bad experience i ordered items and didn't receive it plus i sent more than 2 mails and chat but also no reply,1

2019,Many products are not available in Hyderabad (India).It might be the best app if all the products available in India. Thankyou.,3

2019,Love Zara always,5
2019,Not good After spending quite some time on line shopping for just the right items I got to the end and that's when all the drama started.

2019,"Very slow working , without good info üëé",1
2019,"The app is awesome but I truly believe Zara will benefit from incorporating following: a) input an area where customers can save items for purchasing later. b) establish a Zara Closet which would be an assist to many Zara customers like my self. c) I want to be a ZARA model, I have the ""look"" for the styles in real time.",5

2019,"I love Zara clothes but I HATE this app! The layout is really fiddly, I don't love how the clothes are presented on a lot of models. ASOS makes moving around the app and finding things so easy, they have runway videos so you can see the item in real time, and there are so many category options.

2019,"Nothing is perfect. Of course, there are a few minor flaws but I still find this app is great in many ways. Compared to other shopping apps (from big brand names), this app works way better than those so that I can finish transactions in the app without feeling need of opening a web browser.",5
2019,This app should leave a room for individual item reviews. This would help customers make the right choices when buying items and reduce the number of returns.,3
2019,Good,5
2019,Worst experience ever. Never recieved my parcel nor a refund.,1
2019,Super slow!,1
2019,"No option to choose India under region. Hence can't see relevant collections. This is elementary folks, you have stores here, you should have this region as an option.",1
2019,nice super,5
2019,why always asking permission for track order...while open the app every time?!,1
2019,Very bad application... And service... You make an order and get a confirmation letter... Then when ask where is the order.. Surprisingly .. they inform you.. Maybe it's out of stock or something wrong happened to that item.. without even inform you of that.,1
2019,The log in system is old-fashioned,1

2019,Whyyyy have you deactivated the one thing that helps in locating a product in stores? Then offering complete and utter confusion on the said item being in stock then not. No opportunity to be notified if item comes in. I did have the item saved since this morning and not only is it totally gone but I can't even resave it. Deleting it and uploading again didn't make this app any better. Annoyed me so yup gonna delete.,1
2019,Won't let me change password,1
2019,"At last! A well-designed, stylish and functional app that actually does what I want it to do. The Zara app makes shopping through an app a pleasure. It looks good, for a start. Everything works as it should and browsing items and placing an order is a breeze... once you place an order the app asks if you'd like it to take a screenshot of your confirmation. I've never had an app ask this before - and as it's something I would normally do myself, I think it's a really useful feature!",5

Yes it says ""estimated delivery date"", but in my experience that means maybe 1-2 days late. Not only did it not arrive 2 days later, but when I tried to ""chat"" with the helpline and ask if this is common, all they did was say ""sorry"" and not even address my question. Will never purchase again",1

Select ""edit"" and then tap all the things you want to buy later. I don't know if there is any easier way, but that's what I did.

2019,"No ability to sort by and every time I click into an item it resets the search and I have to scroll through hundreds of items again you get back to where I was - this would be ok if there was a heart option where you could shortlist, but there isn't this option either. It just makes using the app extremely frustrating - it's frankly much easier in a browser.",1
2019,Too slow and hasn't opened only since a week,1
2019,Its terrible,1
2019,Hey guys you can't purchase from ZARA online store if you live in country side because they do not have delivery option for people outside of the major cities. Very dissapointed.,2
2019,Slow response. Too much fancy image made it so hard to download. The screen keep freezing. Finally give up because i had a headache just scrolling to it. Just keep it simple and user friendly please. I want to find what i need quickly.. no need to be impressed with fancy images and head spinning layouts.,1

2019,Doesn't give you an option to collect from the nearest shop,2
2019,"The app does what it's supposed to, but it's difficult to see the products because of the over-artistic pictures and frankly it's pretty annoying to have to scroll through bunch of pictures with the model's face on it (like why are they even there?!). Sometimes simpler is truly better Zara. Another great improvement to this app would be better scroll down feature, because it often goes crazy and opens up random things when I just want to see more pictures of the product.",4
2019,Nice,5
2019,"Love Zara clothing and like the app too. Works well, no real glitches. Just wish I'd get notifications thru the app when things I've saved and added to my cart are made available and/or back in stock.",4

2019,"worst products ever, i ordered shoes and they started losing their colour now the colour is all over my shoes and they are now spoiled. This is what the international brand zara provides. Don't be a fool to purchase from them online",1
2019,I am unable create my account in the app. My phone is OnePlus 5T.,1

2019,Easy to use,4
2019,One of the most thought-through apps I have interfaced with. Very user friendly and picture quality and details is exceptional which makes shopping online not such an intimidating task.,5
2019,"Works okay mostly, but is quite heavy on data usage - a setting to receive compressed imagery is welcome. Beside that, the UI is shoddy at best; it can be a pain to navigate. And to top it off, you can't even make a wishlist - something I think is widely regarded as a universal feature of shopping apps. Embarrasing for a multinational of this size.",2
2019,nice,5
2019,I love it ... I ordered online and took parcel at the store .. amazing ggggggg,5
2019,I opened the app several times but it keeps popping up the ad for subscription of the newsletter. I already subscribed but it has continued to block my access to the site.,1
2019,There is no way I can track the delivery schedule.,2

2019,The loading bar on top never stops and is EXTREMELY annoying!!! Very slow as well!!,1
2019,It's terrible! I do not recommend downloading it.,1
2019,Difficult to navigate. Tries too hard to be dynamic and creative when all I want to go is look at clothes and sizes. This app makes me dizzy and my head hurt. Also difficult to find sizing chart and delete old addresses.,1
2019,nothing to describe just wowwwwwü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,5
2019,"Everytime you go this app ,everytime any selected outfit is unavailable or else no size available, y then they keep those outfits pics unable to understand, its waste of time, at least try to bring stock back or better delete those outfit",2

2019,I dont know which programming language the developer is using in this app but the app is very slow and products take time to load especially if you want to go one step back. I think the app needs more hard work to be optimal,2
2019,Cannot find width of boot or shoe,1
2019,"The location page for in store availability information literally never worked. Wouldn't hold the keypad up long enough to plug in a 5-digit zip code, and if you found the patience to pull it up 5x to punch in one digit at a time, it wouldnt load the info anyways. I finally uninstalled the app in fury after unsuccessfully trying for probably 10 mins. So frustrating",1
2019,I find the app to be extremely confusing.,1

2019,Zara is always do best when it comes to fashion,5
2019,"There's so much ""flashy"" graphics in this app that even navigation is clumsy. When on poor internet, the graphics seems to be prioritized before the products. Missing simple filter functionality.",1
2019,Easy to use and practical,5
2019,Quite slow ‚ò∫,4
2019,Just such a pain to even scroll through collections. I just want to see all shirts or all blouses and it seems impossible to find. User experience is nice if you feel like looking at a magazine but not if you feel like shopping,1
2019,You can't create a wish list. How can they not have a wishlist capability? Baffling. Nonetheless the app is sleek and easy to navigate.,3

2019,Very slow and very frustrating app,1
2019,Good customer services,5
2019,Great app. Very fast and stable.,5
2019,I spent over an hour picking babies clothes with a subtotal of almost 2 thousand and closed the app to do some other things before u edit my items and pay and 57 items later my shopping cart was empty so very unimpressed,1
2019,Worst application ever very slow; hang all the time ; closed when you chose clothes and put clothes i didn't chose it,1
2019,Zara India doesn't ship to Northeast India. FRUSTRATING especially because other shopping sites ship to every nook and corner of the Northeast region. Even the app needs to improve. Why does it take too long to load the pictures!?,1

2019,To find an item the scan product barcode no longer works. You have to manually record the numbers. This feature was very helpful when shopping in store. Everything else is great.,3

2019,not easy to navigate. chat option does not give you access to staff who have access to store inventory information .,1
2019,Customer service on chat sucks stinky hairy balls! Seems none of them know if they are coming or going. I wasn't asking them to solve a math problem. I only asked them to help me change the currency. Seems like a pretty simple question to me if you know your product you should be able to guide the customer. Train your customer service people. Terrible experience from the outset. Meh,1
2019,Zara has the best clothes,5

2019,"aplicatie de 2 lei, am pus in cos produse sa le am ""favorite""si fara macar sa ies din aplicatie mi a disparut tot ce am adaugat la aproape o ora de scroll. useless app",1
2019,Offers no information about the status of your returns. The chat is useful but when you have questions about your returns and providing item numbers is difficult having to flip back and forth between screens. Zara should be able to have information on the items you are returning. You have the ability to select the items you are returning on the invoice (which is great) but that I formation is not provided to customer service and you are asked to provide all the item numbers.,3
2019,love the delivery speed and the quality of clothes,5
2019,"App isn't working, its lagging and not loading at all.",1

2019,very good app i love it,5
2019,"What's happened? I used this app all the time to choose and purchase my items from Zara but they've changed the menu settings so you now have to choose a 'story' of clothes (Dresses, Join Life, New) before you can actually see anything. You can't simply see 'all' womens trousers, or 'all' tshirts because they're split into these pointless groups that mean nothing. Whilst searching for a belt I had to search in 3 different sections. It's a freaking belt, not a needle in a haystack! So frustrating",1
2019,"Worst customer service. Contacted them 4 times about my package and all they say every time is that it's delayed and they can't do anything except to track it. I could've done that.

2019,it's a very good app and really enjoy using it. It's easy and quick to process transactions and provides an excellent online shopping experience. it is also user-friendly and very practical. However there's only one problem- it allows a certain number of order visibility as I'm able to see only 10 orders online and the earlier ones for some reason are not visible. This is a serious issue. I access to Zara app from my Samsung Note 5 smartphone,5

2018,"I have been using this app for sometime now and it's very handy. Specially with introduction of the filter option search is made more easy as compared to the previous version. However, I believe the filters can be improved.",4
2018,"Really deceived by the product I received. The shoes were tried on by many customers, and to ship it, they did not take their time to clean up the shoes that were covered of dust. Left foot shoes looked really old with major scratches, right foot has minor scratches. I think for a brand like Zara, business must be handled in a professional manner. This is the first time I ordered from Zara online and I am beyond deceived. I bought this boots for my graduation, but I don't think I'll put it on on the graduation day.",1
2018,I had a horrible experience using the app for the first time i have been charged abd received an email asking to finisg my paynebt when it accepted it already,1
2018,Should be improved so much more...,3
2018,Best clothing brand. Easy to use app.,5
2018,Really slow to load content.,2
2018,After the update it is not possible to check online availability. It is pointless to browse and not be able to get info on sizes and store availability of the product. Used to be much better app.,2
2018,Good,4
2018,Its the best app,5
2018,Amazing collection..i loved it,5
2018,"I had an older version of the zara app. it asked me to update and with notification it asked me accept permissions to storage, camera, phone, contacts, SMS, location and microphone. Literally everything! why do you need SMS? why microphone? half the permissions are shady af! when I didnt accept it just last night right before black Friday the app updated itself and got access to all permissions! I didnt agree to any of that and this is against the consumer law! I need this to be reviewed and someone get in touch with me!",1
2018,üëç,4

2018,Gud experience quality products must recommend. üòä,5
2018,There is absolutely no point in this app there is no option to purchase at the end. Basically i spent 40minutes selecting styles & sizes to not be able to checkout at the end. Do not waste your time!!,1
2018,I don't like it as I have returned the shoes I needed a smaller size and it says they'll refund the money back which I didn't wanted I just need a smaller size,1

2018,It's really good and I appreciate it,5
2018,Worst app... Actually the reason i gave it 1 bcoz when i try to return my courier... They didnt make even a single response to make it happen and the clothes i get were the worst in my whole life and even they were just kinda playing with me like every time i made a complaint about it and they were like yea sorry for the inconvenience it wont happen again... And then nothing happen at all,5
2018,Very slow to load,2
2018,Very good app,5

2018,Ok,5
2018,Feeling just too boared to say anything,4
2018,Update: The new filter update is amazing! Makes the shopping experience so much easier and better. Why is it that Zara still doesn't allow customers to filter by size? Such a simple feature that is incredibly helpful to customers hence why pretty much every other online fashion stores have had this feature on their websites and apps for years,5
2018,Excellent,5
2018,Best part of my life.,5

2018,Pretty much what i wanted.It has everything for a person who has a good dressing sense. The app is less user friendly when we compare with other online shopping apps.,5
2018,I went to the store 3 times to collect one item and they wouldn't let me collect it since the wifi wasn't working.. the manager didnt even apologise and asked me to come back for the 4th time.. the least they could do is inform the customer not to come to the store if they are not willing to give the product or home deliver it if they have such major issues with their internet connections.. HATED ORDERING VIA THIS APP.. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER..,1

2018,I ain't a hardcore supporter of ZARA but I found that they are innovative and keep improving time after time. But unfortunately ZARA is going way backward in their design and not the old ZARA it used to be after 2014.,5

2018,Great app,5

2018,Not user friendly at all. Rather go to the store and buy. Their shipping charges are exorbitant. No proper tracking available on the app for online purchases. Use this app for reference and window shopping and if you like anything buy it from the store not the app.,1

2018,"Worst app and worst customer service I have returned 1 kid jeans, Its been 20 days now and they didn't refund my money till date even they have not initiated the money to bank till date, unprofessional and irresponsible team they have. My customer care experience is also very bad.",1
2018,Best app,5
2018,"Love the app, great customer service",5
2018,Most unresponsive application and not to mention the worst customer assistance chat service ever. Solving an issue is far away they cant even greet or start a conversation and keeps you waiting for 20 mins just after they say hello. I wish i could zero star this,1
2018,I do enjoyed it..keep it up,5
2018,Worst service provider. Its been 2months and i still did not receive my refund. Very irresponsible crew members,2

2018,Recently i received a false material that i had not ordered. So i returned the material and requested for a refund. Now the zara help line just called me and accused me of cutting the tag that was on the material that i had not oreded. The department cannot just blame the customer of cutting the tag without a legit proof for their own selfish purpose. I give you -10000^n for your support. Thank you,1

2018,You can get best fashionable outfits at very reasonable price,4
2018,Excellent,5
2018,"Super helpful ! I personally love the app version rather than the web version. Searching is very easy, and purchasing is very convenient. Would be more helpful if they give filtering option.",5

2018,5 star,5
2018,"Second time I undowload this app. It won't give you setting to search, the whole this or nothing at all. You should allow customers customize their search.",1

2018,Really disappointed with the chat function... Mid convo it will come up with a message stating.. you have been inactive for a while so be believe the query has now been resolved. I cannot retrieve the same conversation and would then have to explain the whole thing to another agent on another chat window :o,2

2018,"People plz don't buy shoes from Zara quality sucks ,it just tore in 4 days use and worst part is they didn't refund r exchange it because I used it and not just one both shoes tore due to poor stitching . Stressed out with the customer service . No justice served feeling cheated.",1

2018,Stupid app for big company that's not good at all,1
2018,Why do they need access to my Bluetooth in this new update !?,2
2018,Application is broken since you've opened online shopping in India. Highly disappointed. Still broken after multiple weeks.,4

2018,WE NEED FILTERS,3
2018,"I'd give it more. If it let you go back, instead I have to leave the app and go back in. Ordered ok tho. Clothes great. Would prefer if they showed the matching items, instead of having to look them up. Particularly the suits.",4

2018,Bestest app ever i have used it many timEs delievery is very fast best app,5
2018,"Amazing, beautiful quality products, super quick delivery, fuss free returns...What else you need!!",5
2018,Zara is the best among all orders apps Quick delivery in less than 7days. God bless zara,5
2018,Please break your collaboration with DELHIVERY as they make fool of us that today your product will be delivered even after calling them everyday also they dont have th contact nos. Of local delivery offices when we ask them for contacting our local delhivery office. WORT,1
2018,Nice,5
2018,Why the hell Bluetooth access is needed in the update ?,1

2018,Loved it,5
2018,Love it. Mostly working effectively,5
2018,Very easy to use! The only thing I don't like is that it's so easy to use it's making me broke haha üòÇ,5
2018,Nice products,5
2018,"Zara using cheap trick of showing higher price for shoes and gives discount on purchase ,after purchase I found that discount price is actual price of shoes.",4
2018,I always prefer Zara it's the best shopping app to shop,5
2018,Good app and everyone knows zara gives you best design in the market. Then why not,5
2018,Some updates to be done in separation of gender.,4
2018,"This new version requires so many invasive permissions with no apparent reason. Why do you need access to my camera, Bluetooth information and call information now? Uninstalling.",1
2018,"On the latest update, the app asks permission for my camera and bluetooth. Not necessary. Will be uninstalling and check Zara out on a web browser or the store.",2
2018,Perfect,5
2018,What the hell are all these new permissions?,1
2018,Brilliant service and app,5
2018,No offers,1
2018,I love this brand.. thats it,5
2018,ZARA has the best clothing collection amongst all the other online apps.,5
2018,"Zara is playing with us. I bought a chelsea boot recently which was not on discount it was around 60$, and now they are selling the same product in discount but the thing is they increased the original price of the shoe 110$. And the discounted price is stilp the same which is 60$. That means they are selling the products at the original price showing the customers that its on discount. CHEAP TRICKS",2
2018,Works great in NZ..,5
2018,Nice,3
2018,There is no cash on delivery,3
2018,"Closes are great, but app could be better. I miss ""favorites"" option: to be able to save closes that I liked without putting them in basket. Still didn't find where to sort items by price.",2
2018,I want the money writing in Europe money,5
2018,Awsome,5
2018,Sometimes should be updated little bit more faster...but the rest is fine üòÄ,5
2018,The best clothing line for me.,5
2018,"Brilliant, love it!",5
2018,Why don't add Albania in Zara store?,3
2018,I think that zara should include exact measurements of all clothes so that we are able to justify whether the size can fit nicely upon we make purchase and reduce the chances of goods return.,4
2018,Store availability not working in Egypt,1
2018,Very good app.I live in Kolkata and we have only one outlet here but still I ordered a jacket from the app and got it within one day. Loved it.,5
2018,App defaults the purchase to store pick up when I could have done delivery. Only aware of this after payment is made and conformation says to pick up from a particular store without the option of delivery or even choosing your preferred store.,1
2018,Does all that it needs to.,5
2018,Gobar,5
2018,(check in-store availability) option not working right now in Egypt and seller man told me every time i go this products not available Right now and i a sure he hide them,1

2018,Perfect and love the alerts when items are back in stock. Beautiful clothes and easy to use site.,5
2018,Simple to use. Always accurate and up to date.,5
2018,Excellent!,5
2018,I hate to compare but the Mango app works better. Aside from showing how much an item costs this app will be so much better if it shows what store the item is available in and even order thru the app,3
2018,Excellent,5
2018,Good app but app is too slow and varities of clothes is less than showroom of zara,3
2018,Well organized,4
2018,Amezing,5
2018,Seems cool.,5

Spoke to someone at customer serivice desk and was asked to wait for another 12 days for the refund to fallback into my account and place a new order altogether. On top of that, the agent claimed that I did something wrong while placing the order which doesnt make sense to me at all. Extremely disappointed with the customer service I received. This is Zara I'm writing about which is one of.my favorite brands.",3

2018,"Good brand but should focus on quality, clothes are not long lasting",5
2018,Love it so easy to use and easy when you want to return no need for recite,5
2018,"I love the app and I believe that there is nothing wrong with it. However, my country (Paraguay) is not available on the countries list. Does this mean that the app is useless for me?",4
2018,Accurate and satisfying.,5
2018,Love zara,5
2018,Its very good app,5
2018,Not showing customer reviews and stars,2
2018,WORST online shopping experience ever! Wish I could give zero stars.,1
2018,Doesn't provide proper service,1

2018,Easy browsing and checking out!!,5
2018,Makes shopping a pleasure. My favorite shopping app. Well done Zara.,5
2018,Awesome,5
2018,"Works well in some aspects, but poor in others. My main frustration is that the 'Pay at till' button brings up a QR code that is not recodnised by the tills when your payng with a gift card that has been loaded onto the app. To use a gift card in store, you have to navigate back to the wallet screen and tap Gift Cards, and provided you have internet access, your gift cards will appear. This is usually not a problem for the ladies, but if you're a bloke, you'll always have problems with the signal as the Mens department is more often than not, located in the basement. Most of the apps functionality relies on having an internet connection. It would be great if you could scan an item and it save it in the cache until you have a connection. Otherwise, it's a nice clean app and relatively easy to navigate.",3
2018,Nice,5
2018,The collections are countless !! Very confusing about which one to buy and which one not to!,5
2018,Smooth,5
2018,I wish there was an option to filter the selection. Right now you need to go to every product and check for availability.,4
2018,Very easy to use,5
2018,"I cant find sydney in the maps, is the US the same as Australia? Does the clothes from the US season match Australia?",3

2018,Loved it best brand,5
2018,"So far, so good!!",5
2018,"Dope app. Ease of use, HD pictures and simple interface.",5
2018,"As a South African, it gives no options for my country or currency or codes . It didn't recognize it all, even though they have more 5 outlets here. filters are horrible and navigation on the app has no direction. I hate.I guess now I have to go to the store directly as an online shopper",1
2018,"It's a clean design, well thought off",5
2018,Easy way.Fantastic,5

2017,A wishlist or favourites option would add value to the app + sorting the clothing via size (at least). I get bored browsing through every single item for hours until I find if my size is available at all.,4
2017,Product is available in the shop then also it doesn't appear in the application,5
2017,"I like the app, however, what made me rate it 4 stars and not 5 was the fact that it feels very limited. Other than that I like it.",4
2017,"Needs categories so I can filter stuff like gender, products and sizes",3

2017,Love this app,5
2017,"For now I'm giving this app three stars. It is easy to navigate and I do like the way the clothing is presented. What stopped me though from giving this app five, or even four, stars is that you cannot filter or sort clothing. It could be a marketing ploy of sorts but it is something I find annoying to the point where I find the app a turn off. Also, something that is not necessary, but I always like it when shopping apps have a ""wishlist"" or ""like"" option for products. It makes it easier find or remember the products you love but are not ready to buy.",3

2017,"The fulfillment center does not provide visibility as to when your order will be shipped. Finding out when your order will arrive is also hilariously inconvenient to check on. The 24x7 chat function is not available through the application. So going to the website through your browser is necessary for additional support but you run into the critical issue that the chat service actually doesn't provide support for customers or online purchases which blows my mind as to what their purpose is. Fast forward to the calling the only number listed at all which happens to say ""customer service"" doesn't actually help consumers either or connect you with anyone. They give you an unlisted number to a fulfillment company who staffs people who can only order or provide instructions on how to get a refund. They also give you a date range of delivering products from the day you order through 30 days out with zero visibility to where your 600 dollar order is. She did mention to order a better shipping method which made no sense since you cannot choose your method and she didn't know what carrier would be used. Back to the application, slow loading, fit feature isn't compatible, sizes are not uniform across their own brand, models measurements aren't provided just their height which makes no sense either. Overall it makes considerably more sense just to go to their store so you can actually get your discounts, get your product, get straight answers, and not deal with this inept Spanish/Turkish fashion company's poor operations and development team. In short, the application sucks.",3

The size selection menu of the products while adding them to shipping bag does not match the sizes on the in-store availability menu. For example if the sizes of a certain product ranges from xs to xl; you can add the desired size to your shopping bag but cannot look for the in-store availability for the exact sizes. The sizes range from s to xxl. So weird.",1

2017,I cannot do online purchase ad i cant find the shopping cart icon. please help.,1
2017,Good collection,5
2017,There are no filters and real time updates of what Is left in any Zara shops,1
2017,Amazing,5
2017,Love ZARA ‚ù§,5
2017,"Does not have South Africa listed yet the stores are listed, hence I can't register properly",1
2017,Please help me.. I am nt able to register..!! It's asking a province option..!! Uh am sick .. plz hlp me.. I wanna buy clothes,2
2017,Simple n precise.Easy navigation.,4
2017,"Like this app, it's really wonderful thing",5
2017,If only they had a filter option.,5
2017,I like this app it has what I'm looking for,5
2017,The best app üòä,5
2017,It's pretty easy and simple to operate. Though sometimes loading picture is too slow. I wish there were more filters to find specific products easier. It also helps to indicate the size that the model is wearing.,4
2017,It doesn't deliver in India,1
2017,There should be an option to filter available sale items by size. With the existing setup you are required to search through tons of items until you are lucky enough to find something available in your size. It seems like common sense to me.,1
2017,That's Good,5
2017,"No filttering, sorting or favorite!",2
2017,Excellent,5
2017,Pathetic app. Useless too... It good for nothing ... No online purchase neither its shows aaviblity in different cities al over country It jus shows nearby one city and own city. In my case it was showing aviablity in mall near me and in actual it was not available!!!! Highly disappointed Neither othr city store arrange delivery neither own city store took order . The pune store manager said he cant arrange d product to be delivered frm diff city in their store...its not the case in other brands. Highly disappointed. .its a common sense someone wud nt travel to differnt city just to buy product. ... Also zara store manager should be enough polite to appreciate that someone is so keen on buyin d product,1
2017,Such an beautiful app,5
2017,Excellent,5
2017,Love Zara and love having the ease of the app,5
2017,The app is probably great but not available in Australia.,1
2017,"Love it, let's you return items and is easy to use. Only downsize is that I can't filter by size",5
2017,I cant find the option to order and buy ..Need heLp,3
2017,Its quick and brilliant,5
2017,Why not in india üò∂üò∂,1
2017,I xoxo love ZARA app..,5
2017,Good,4
2017,I love this app..use it all the time. The shop availability isn't specific nor accurate. It would be nice to buy from the shops directly if the warehouse has no stock.,4
2017,Fn DC in DC in WV dd,5
2017,Good when I need to order online after a store visit.,4
2017,üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå,5
2017,GG,5
2017,"You can't do fine grained filtering, so you are forced too see items not in stock. I'd tiresome seeing pieces you want and then realising that they don't have them over and over again. And you can't search on sizes, basically you can't search on anything. Useless.",1
2017,It shld have online shopping,3
2017,Awesome,5
2017,"Love the Zara app. Very easy to find what your looking for. Sizing and info about product is top notch. The only thing I wish they did was tell us what size the model is wearing seeing as they give us their height. So maybe adding size with height so we can get a visual idea about sizing, due to Zara being Europe sizing.",5
2017,Love brand,5
2017,This app is amazing and easy to use I do more shopping at Zara's because it's so convenient. Too many features to point out individually but they are all great.,5
2017,I dont have access to the tracking number. I only can see the bar code,2

To know if the jacket is available in nearby Zara stores, it first told me to choose the size. And the options given to me were 02, 03, 04, 05, 06.

2016,"Zara has one the best shopping apps available, and the clothes are awesome. I love that all of my purchases are stored in the app. Using ""my digital Zara wardrobe"" helps me put together outfits without the hassle of digging through my closets. Most importantly Zara's clothing is always high quality, I never regret a purchase made or have to worry about an item ""going out of style"", this clothing is timeless!",5
2016,Perfect!,5
2016,Please guys the time is now .,3
2016,Amazing,4
2016,Would like a filtering function and add items to wishlist. It takes a while for non available items to stop displaying and/or show that they are out of stock (don't know until you actually try to buy them). Not being able to cancel an order due to repeated technical errors.,3

2016,I love this app! I use it daily. I love being able to easily shop online through this app rather than going in the store!!,5
2016,Fyi - What you are accepting by tapping 'approve' is that you allow the app to have access to pretty much all the private info on your phone. What's up with that?! Deleted the app right away..,1
2016,Gimana cara belinya. Kok gak ada. Mau beli banyak. Sayangnya gak bs,1
2016,Always up to date... easy to use and even easier to buy... Love zara... and LOVE using this app... my life is complete! !!,5

2016,"The app is amazing and so are the products in store, you could fix the barcode scaner, but I don't think that it is an important for the concept of the app. Amazing! Love your store, so much affordable clothes with style. My favorite store ever!",5
2016,What's the use of the app if there is no buying option available for India on the app...,3
2016,"And that is something that probably can be done by google. But zara is not google. Mango divides it by categories man, woman, kid, etc and then you can see options for each of them.",1
2016,Not for Australia,1
2016,Update price in cart if item goes on sale. Otherwise I love itüòôüòô,5

2016,Why do you need my contacts access??,2
2016,awesome collection,5
2016,"The app may be ok, but the permissions it requests to get installed are just fabulous: browsing history, bookmarks, pics.. A shopping app doesn't need all this, you're paying for the clothes, don't need to pay with your personal info too.",1

2016,Superb app,5

2016,Why is there no option to create our accounts if we're from India? Because if the app doesn't give us the permit to shop online from India then this app is useless for us! I suggest you to check the below comments cuz most of them are from India. I recommend you guys to introduce it asap so that we can also make use of the privileges available in the market.,2

Doesn't allow me to renew my password because it can't identify that I've typed the confirmation password. I have to go through this process every time for a purchase. Upside is that I've noticed nfc credit card function is now available. There was also a prompt to save the receipt in my gallery, all nice touches.",3
