2023,1,"Not entirely sure what's going on, but the app was working fine a few days ago. Now, it won't even let me login or click anything. All that appears on the screen is the company's logo and that's it. I tried uninstalling and redownloading the app to see if it help. Sadly, nothing has change. Hopefully this can be fix asap, in the meanwhile I have to go on my web browser through my cell or laptop device."

2023,5,easy to use choose and navigate

2023,5,"Previously thought H&M was just for youngsters, but discovered that their products are so varied that I, at 75, still find lots to buy from them. Their service is brilliant, delivery is always fast, and returns have been, at least up until now, excellent (I hear, and fear, that this may be changing - hope not!) Clothes are good value and home products are ""different"" - in a good way! I happily recommend H&M to everone."

2023,1,Never ever purchase from app. They don't provide refund
2023,1,Stupid app gets stuck with smart lock

2023,2,"Why can't I see the full description on the size that model wears it's only showing half of the information untill size after that there's no actual information on what exact size XL m xs s nothing. Pls fix it before it used to show it properly, if I can't see the reference then how come I could place order for the perfect size for me. Pls pls pls fix this, I am currently stuck due to can't take reference according to the model height and what size he wearing in the photo, so I can't purchase it"

2023,5,good
2023,1,"Please don't order from this app, never gives back the return fund on time!!! frustrating, and the amount is not small that we can ignore, all products thousands and more and if you don't get the money back it's wrong"
2023,5,🔥
2023,1,This is the most useless app in the world
2023,5,"quality,price, size ,looks all super👍"
2023,1,I'm not getting my refund even after 1 month despite continuous calls and mails.
2023,5,Love H&Ms cool style affordable fashion!
2023,3,"Why rating 3? Because they have increase the price drastically just because they have attract alot of customer sand the app sucks. Always under maintenance and can't add to favorite all most all the time i in login😕 Other than this, clothes are nice. 10/10"
2023,2,I ordered from this app like a thousand times and every time the sizes are all wrong like let me give u an example: I ordered recently 2 tops and a pair of trousers all M and they sent me L and XL please h&m fix this! I'm a regular customer and that's unacceptable !!
2023,3,discounts are not real!
2023,1,Worst app to order any online clothes they dont give responds to cash on delevry purchases they dont even send the parcels on time worst app not wanted to even give a single star rating to them
2023,4,"Wish navigation and finding items were easier- search function not that great. otherwise once you find things, ordering is pretty streamlined."
2023,4,al like the clothes and good quality but it's hard to get the right size. the S is like a medium and so on.

2023,5,shopping made convenient!
2023,3,"Well, I have been shopping from H&M from the past few years and yeah got the membership too, but everytime I shop obviously it says that it'll give me points but why am I not getting any points even after getting my membership scanned. It's always on Zero. Rest I really like it. I just don't understand why am I not given points"
2023,1,"Terrible app always buggy. Had this app for years always buggy.Gives u weird taxes and different pricing even with free delivery/shipping they are changing the prices. Even if u changed nothing on ur order. customer service ""disconnects"" and the connection is ""lost"" and u lost the person u were talking to. Only want to buy here for one thing for somelse's for gift they picked out,don't like most of the mid-low quality.every now and then they have kinda nice things on sale but most of it is blah"
2023,5,love H&M quality clothes at good prices
2023,1,Horrible customer service and they took away free shipping from handicapped persons such as me who is in a wheelchair ♿️ and very old we are now penalized by this company who puts greed above it's customers 😢 everyone is upset by this and your delivery charges are crazy and irresponsible to say the least. jbergthun
2023,1,"It was good before, but from August, I can't log in into my account, as it says my data is incorrect. If I change password it still shows that's it's incorrect, although password is 100% correct and email is proper. I tried several times. On the line to fix it I need to wait over 5 minutes and still no response on how to fix it."
2023,2,"I think it's high time I start shopping from myntra instead, before it said free delivery on the order of 999 but now it says 1999 that too 149 is charge for delivery... I would treat myself with that amount instead than shipping charge"
2023,5,nice
2023,1,Can you please add another option of payment in you application like gcash.
2023,5,it's superb fantastic 👍
2023,1,"I'm sorry to say this but h&m doesn't not return the money, it's been 5 month l didn't received my refund."
2023,2,w2 2 2e22e
2023,1,"Used to be able to easy access settings, log out, but no longer !!"
2023,1,"I ordered 6 days ago from this app. They have been delaying my order, showing failed delivery attempt without attempting any delivery. Worst experience till now."
2023,2,Exchange option not available
2023,3,"The worst part is that it doesn't give proper information about the product , i returned a dress even after pick up there is no notification regarding pickup if you are giving any product then it is necessary to asure your customer that their products or money is safe . Lack of proper information is bad impression to your site overall the products are good and service is also good but the technical issues are happening everytime"
2023,3,"there's a bugg in the app, I'm not able to login, I'm pressing the log in button but nothing happens"
2023,1,I do not have access to my offers or digital receipts. it's been a week.
2023,1,Worst experience ever I had while doing online shopping.... The customer care people don't have manners to talk to the person...
2023,5,Easy to shop
2023,5,Please get more expensive 😫 plz
2023,5,"This app is easy to use, didn't have any problems so far. I recommend it."
2023,1,"The forgot password function does not work at all. I have tried to get back my original account for THREE months and the email never arrives. I have tested it with a new account too, and same results, both on mobile and desktop. This should be a basic feature that works. I'm giving a one star review until this is somehow fixed."
2023,5,best filter
2023,5,never problem with H&M. I have used it for 11 years very well.
2023,5,Can't access app or website for days. What is happening?
2023,5,"Perfect Fitting, Quality and Good rate provided by H&M"
2023,5,gh
2023,4,good
2023,1,"Δεν λειτουργεί! Δεν μπορώ να δω καν τα κουπόνια μου,στης εκπτώσεις λέει συνέχεια οτι τα βρίσκω στο λογαριασμό μου,όμως δεν φαίνεται τίποτα. Ουτε αποσύνδεση δεν μπορώ να κάνω, σαν να λείπει μισή σελίδα."
2023,4,needs more clothing options but overall it's good
2023,1,I use to order quite often from this app n I pretty much like this app but one fine day my product was suppose to get delivered idk wat so happened the delivery guy started using abusive words while I easn explaining him where to deliver my product waat s terrible experience just cuz of this guy I'm goona stop ordering anything from this app terrible experience with the delivery guy
2023,4,Tiop
2023,1,First experience... And was the worst for me ..... The app already has its features problem and on top of the even the delivery guy was rude ... Wow..!! Busy cursing me with abusive words ... Won't order from here again ...!!
2023,1,Overrated too much prise with low quality in Clothes
2023,5,It's awesome as it is 🕶️
2023,1,Guys never shop from these looters. They've written it's hassle free returns but I swear to God they'll never even attempt to pickup and your return pickup will be a nightmare and leave about the refund it's gone. It's been more than 15days I've returned the product but nobody has arrived here to collect the item as far as so concerned. So invest in some other brand where there would be an hassle free return services and save your money.
2023,5,amazing products and style for kids. love shopping at H&M
2023,1,"Items are not showing, prices are wrong, filters do not work. It's totally not functioning. It's ridiculous how such a large company is not capable of hiring professionals to properly maintain their app."
2023,4,"Convenient for browsing and keeping a list of your favorite items, but very glitchy. Product pages don't load properly, sometimes you can't place things in your cart, today product pages displayed in French (on the UK version)."
2023,1,"If you try to filter for anything or view categories... 0 products. Even if you check the ""show all"" and in line with that it shows a number in the range of hundreds or thousands of products, after filtering = 0 products found. Tried with colour, product type and everal others. Same with the website.."
2023,4,This app good
2023,1,App unstable keeps shutting down
2023,1,Can't use the filter option. Though there are products of that category once we apply the filter it shows 0 products.
2023,5,Good and shopping is to easy and fast delivery
2023,1,Horrible horrible horrible site settings.. keeps getting stuck at payment and then deleting items saying out of stock.
2023,1,"The orders placed with discount offers are having ""payment errors"" reported after the promotional campaign is over. Until then your money (online payed order) ar blocked and ypu can see the order placed in the app. After this they refound you the money and there is no trace of the order (deleted from the app). Happened 3 time last week dunring the 20% off for kids clothes campaign. I will never order again from this app ."
2023,2,I don't understand whenever i am trying to add something to my wish list it's showing error. Its annoying! How else am i supposed to save items ? Worst shopping experience.
2023,5,👌❤️
2023,4,"Everything is smooth, but for returning any order that you paid through COD, they will only refund to your bank account. Why??"
2023,1,"I love the clothes and variety BUT almost everything I like is out of stock! Also, I earned those 100 points with my hard earned money which h&m is giving away freely to new members?! What about us who had already taken the membership?! Not fair to your loyal members."
2023,3,"Very easy to use, but Ihave to update my review, I don't know why since the last update I can't save anything in my favorites or even erase something from my shopping bag... Update 11/ 08/23 I pur thing in my shopping bag and when I try to buy it tells me there's a mistake in the system, guess for now can't purchase anything online..."
2023,5,love it
2023,5,decent stuff and good service.
2023,5,great quality
2023,3,nice dress for women stylish and functional
2023,5,Easy and quick to use app.
2023,1,"Worst experience, they vanished my 10% discount"
2023,5,"Love the discounts and specials for H&M online members, I believe your site is the best online site for shopping of all the high street stores, well done H&M. Love browsing your shop in Dame street and looking forward to your shop opening on the old Clearys site. Your staff are always top notch friendly and helpful, especially the staff in Dundrum."
2023,4,Please add login with Google account option. Or at least allow browser to remember password. Every time I open this app I need to reset the password because it's not used very often
2023,1,"If you ever try to filter for a size, you'll have a horrible experience! For example, I tried to find size L clothes and I clicked on something that I liked and there was only size XS avaliable. 🙃 Great! Countless of times has this happened to me. And this is going on for at least 2 years, it's not just a bug. This app ist TRASH!!!"
2023,1,Delivery charge worst. All other e commerce website gives free delivery order above 499. But h&m charge 150₹ delivery fee in order less then 1999 . It's irritating.you must provide a hm bag with the product. H&m product available on Myntra their delivery much friendly. They are giving much more coupons.So who gonna buy from you . We will buy from. It's a serious concern.
2023,1,Always freezing orders page. Mega annoying. Client service not helpful
2023,3,delivery fee is high

2023,5,I love my H&M app
2023,2,"I ORDER A SHIRT AND IT DIDN'T CAME ,it was cancelled by its own, i am ordering it again!!! NOT SATISFIED!!"
2023,4,I'm very loyal to H&M but the app always has a bug! I can't see my coupons anymore for some reason and just in general glitchy
2023,5,"Gute Qualität , gute Preise , tolle Angebote , gute Member Rabatt und schnelle Lieferung ."
2023,5,H&M app is very convenient for shopping clothes & accessories. Simple and clean interface make it easier to take decision faster.

2023,5,Good app
2023,1,the parcel which i order is cancel by the delivery not even ask me for once there should be cancel OTP as well so that the delivery boy won't cancel by themselves
2023,1,"Lately very bad experience. App is not working oroperly ank keeps ""freezing"" while going trough product offers. Havent been able to acces Order history, payments and etc for a while - the option simply is not working and it is not possible to enter My Account! Been loyal for some time now but seems like that has to change!"
2023,1,My accounts page has been buffering for over a week now which is very inconvenient
2023,5,I like it brand
2023,1,App bugs out quite a lot. It won't let me log in so I can't use my points 😔
2023,2,"I can not access the membership area of the app all of a sudden, and nothing I'm trying is working!"
2023,1,"Their return policy never works. The person coming to take back cloths will give some lame excuse, like he has too many clothes to take back today! Worst CC also. Never buy from here."
2023,1,The app is not working
2023,1,"The App won't show my account profile. It says ""go to your account to uncover a sweet reward"" and for the past WEEK I haven't been able to look at my points or anything, it's ""loading"" and it never does."
2023,5,loving the sport gear!
2023,1,"Can't access my account it's just loading, but nothing comes.... it used to work very well... I don't know what's going on"
2023,5,good
2023,1,Why did you make it so complicated ... I can't change app language. Though I stay in Norway but can't read Norwegian. Handling app with minimal understanding of any lang is so difficult. Please keep different option for language.
2023,1,"Stuck on loading screen, can't even login"

2023,5,What I love about this app .no delivery charges..but today I noticed it taking delivery charges..am soo disappointed
2023,1,"This is the most disappointing application and service I've ever encountered. I installed the app, filled out the membership form, but when I clicked on ""join now,"" the button didn't work. It seems like you intentionally disabled the button. If you don't want people to join your membership, why advertise it like this? These practices are unethical."
2023,1,One of the worst series I have every experience l. I would request everyone to never try to order products online. They deliver damage product or try to fool us my taking pre paid payment & then which delivery time then ask for COD. This kind of series this brand is providing. Every one be careful with this. I don't want this to happen with you so sharing my experience with you all.
2023,1,"Unable to click on my account. When I click the person for my account it just goes to an empty page so I'm unable to check for discounts or vouchers, my membership or order checks."
2023,1,"IT DOESN'T WORK!!!!! Several months ago it's stopped to allow me to shop with Klarna. And now, ""my account"" page is not opening. I can't log out or see my rewards, customer id etc. It's so annoying!"
2023,5,Thanku
2023,1,Impossible to open my account within the app. I'm a regular customer with lots of points which I now can't see and can't use a voucher I have. No longer trust the app. Sort it out please.
2023,4,"No clear way to change delivery address. Points are gone, time is wasted, mobile app is not useful at all."
2023,1,"I do not know what is goin on with hnm these days😠this app cant show my orders n account info,how am i supposed to track n see my orders,getting wrong orders,or package damaged during transportation or items lost/stolen every damn time,and after all that they cant give u a discount after all that poor customer service n delivery,at this point am considering shopping at zara,they should fix these problems,PLEASE STOP USING PITNEY BOWES CARRIERS THEY R THE WORSE,LOST ITEMS all the time.😡"

2023,5,loved it
2023,5,best
2023,1,I got scammed by H&M. They refused to refund my money lol. And Their customer service sucks better to use other shopping apps rather than H&m (fraud).
2023,5,excellent
2023,3,Useful when you need something specific RIGHT NOW at a reasonable.
2023,1,There's problem every other day on the app. Gives me anxiety whenever I have to purchase something. All the good items are always out of stock
2023,5,Love it
2023,1,Abysmal app. Apparently I get 20% off for being a member. The app knows I'm a member. I make an order. I don't get 20% off because I didn't enter a code. Why do I need a code if you know I'm a member? H&M blacklisted.
2023,1,Lot of bugs and now app is really not working and responding
2023,1,Cannot use my vouchers in physical stores. Please give customer physical vouchers if you can't fix the bugs!!!
2023,5,"Honestly, my experience with H&M for purchase, delivery and refund processes are all great. They deliver on the given time, refund very quickly and the clothing materials are very valuable which are very hard to find in stores, some users who complain about sizes dont know how to measure correctly and some users dont know how to properly add their payment details for refund. From their side H&M is delivering what they claim and that is truly satisfying, trust me you wont regret shopping here."
2023,5,nice and fashionable
2023,1,Don't buy! They scam people... you paid for something else and they send you different quality product in same as shown in the app... report such mf company
2023,1,"Fix this app pls , If only H&M had better software development practices, the app wouldn't crash and would be less buggy. Additionally, I am unable to place orders using COD; it displays a message stating ""not approved,"" and I'm unsure why. Despite reaching out to over 5 agents, the response remains the same: clear the app cache or delete the data. I have decided to permanently delete the app; that's what I have conveyed."
2023,5,My favourite shopping app!
2023,5,تتاتخختلق!!!!؟؟
2023,5,awesome collection
2023,1,"Hi, please fix the app, it prompt error message that there is no Internet connection, but my mobile is connected to WiFi. Please advise urgently."
2023,5,Best app for premium and regular purchasing of apparel.
2023,5,love it for kids clothing
2023,4,very well
2023,5,Love this store
2023,4,"I love H&M because they have my sizes. They also have cute designs and not so expensive. Some of the materials that their using is not all comfortable but as soon as you get familiar with it, ( buying & returning ) you knew exactly what to order, next."
2023,5,good quality
2023,1,Intiated me refund for wrong item in the order. That is half the amount i owe them and their customer service doesnt respond everyday the time given is please call after 2 or 3 days. And emails are never replied or responded. Pathetic experience in returns.
2023,1,I'm having problems on opening new account
2023,1,"First of all the reset your password functionality does not work. If you try to use it, no email is sent. It only works only of you reset your password from the browser. Second, once you do reset your password, you can login from the browser, but you can't login from the app. It says that the password does not match the login email. Clearly the is a sync problem in your database. I'm giving 1 star because I simply cannot use the app whatsoever."

Pénz visszautalási díjat nem az én pénzemből kellene levonni. Nem is rendelek SOHA többet, mert csak visszaküldeni lehet, boltba visszavinni nem."

2023,5,"Awesome app. There isn't as much new content as in other apps, but it works perfectly, the filter options are great, easy to use and affordable prices."
2023,1,i had ordered products from 2 products H&M app. One was a black short and one was a pack of two tshirts. I received white pants and only one out of the two tshirts. Naturally i returned the products by raising a complaint and manual pick up was initiated. It has been a month and i have not received my refund. After the contacting the customer service they are saying the products were not received in the warehouse. I will resort to consumer forums or legal action if the matter is not resolved.
2023,1,"The worst app ever. They mention 10% discount on first order but when you apply it, they say voucher removed. Guys I'm uninstalling this app and request everyone to un install. Never buy their products from other partners too. Very unethical."

2023,1,"Waste app and waste agents Return policy late , late response and no.1 waste app in all apps . Agents exit the chat while chatting with you. I prefer don't install and don't order any thing in this app. These agents are to bad reply and rudely talking with others. Worst app in universe. Don't use this app . Go and order another app."

2023,1,I paid but my order got stuck and didn't go through. I think I lost my money.
2023,1,"I like the store as a whole but the app itself doesn't work for some reason it won't even let me log in I can only scroll through the clothes I can't get anything unless I sign in,which I can't do"
2023,5,it's a wonderful app for buying authentic clothes
2023,1,This app is getting worse. Whenever I ordered anything my order gets cancelled. I hate whenever this happens. I have experienced this twice that when my parcel is on the way it gets returned automatically and does not get delivered. The order gets out of stock after my order have been placed.
2023,5,"I like all clothing for a baby, good quality, do not get smaller after washing. Buying clothes for my kid from birth."
2023,1,"Don't get me wrong, I like the product but this app is filled with loads of bugs, there are problems with order status, and if we choose to return a product it's notification never comes after we do the process, refunds are initiated only if we email their customer service."

2023,1,I just hate this app and brand also. The customer care service is so rude to talk and they don't value their customers at all. I had ordered a dress from this app and returned it back as there was no price tag on it. But they did not initiate my refund amount back to my account and said that I have sent a mismatched article and not the same dress. It's been already a month I'm facing the issue with Hnm app. Such a disgusting behaviour and brand. I have stopped shopping from this app.
2023,1,Worst app #boycott Sweden
2023,2,"I've been facing multiple issues. I couldn't add products on my wishlist. And the biggest issue is I can't sign in. It keeps showing ""The email ID or the password is incorrect"", even though I entered the correct email ID and password. I even changed the password but still it keeps showing that. And just today I placed an order and when I reopened the app it keeps telling me to sign in. Even the membership was not showing. Now I can't even track my order. Please fix this issue."

Now there's no beautiful products nothing to buy nothing is interesting anymore . If you can't give us new things then bring us again the old things #restort the out of stock products from 2021-22

I didn't receive an order confirmation too. I checked to see if they deducted money from my card, lo and behold, they did. I contacted customer support, and what they told me was that my transaction failed and it could be due to bugs. Needless to say, I won't be using this app again."

Order history/ details page has lot of issues. 1) Many a times incorrect delivery date is shown. 2) Even after returning any product, I see, the return option for the same product. 3) When any order is cancelled, user don't get any update regarding that, every thing happens in dark. 4) When there are 2 or more parcels in one order, there are always above 3 issues. Please resolve these issues."

2023,5,"one of the best website's I've shopped from. everything really easy to do be it returns, add discount codes, rewards etc. love the clothes , love everything H&M."
2023,1,"H&M is a good brand no doubt. But this app is useless. I placed an order three times. Each time it would get cancelled the next day. Upon raising the issue with the customer service, I was told that this item is in stock but the order did not get accepted at the warehouse hence the cancellation. I was asked to place a fresh order with the assurance that this time my order will be accepted. But it got cancelled again. Conclusion - Bought the same item on Myntra."
2023,4,H&M app is really smooth and light (easily loading) compare to other app like amazon India. Hope the team will do much better in coming days.

2023,1,"Love shopping here and love the clothes/deals, but the app itself just doesn't work for no reason. It gives out randomly and won't let me log in on the app. This has been ongoing through a couple of updates, so I'm just assuming the app doesn't work since I've done all the extra things (clearing cache/storage, uninstall/reinstall, new password, etc). Doesn't work at all or save anything which is very frustrating. Just use Chrome or shop somewhere else if you want to actually be able to order."

2023,1,Worst customer service ... rude customer care executive.. I ordered a product and paid already but didn't get my order and they said it's delivered and later the customer executive has the audacity to cut my call without solving or listening to the whole problem... Two of them did the same thing ... It's better to not order from h&m.
2023,2,I could not pay with Paypal in next 30 days
2023,1,Whoever offends the Holy Qur’an has no value nor the products it publishes
2023,1,Shopping with h&m worst experience.... there's refund is very late......even they don't have exchange. Option..... after i return product...it's almost 10 days still didn't get refund....😞 worst shopping experience ..not expecting this from h&m....
2023,5,"Great app, easy to navigate and use"
2023,3,some clothes are very high in quality and fitting but some clothes fade colour quickly and bubbles easily...
2023,5,It's just the best👍😊
2023,1,"For last five years my shipments were delivered to the billing address I've provided in the app, but the recent update of the app has proven to be such an incovenience for the same. It states my address doesn't have the delivery option for the shipments. It's out of my understanding as I just received a parcel with the same add."
2023,4,"I love hm, can find good quality clothes for good price. Very sad, then last time it's become more size+ shop, only big sizes are always available, small sizes not always have (sometimes 34 the smallest sizes)."

2023,1,It is a bastard company. After returned back a parcel to them they are telling like you have to wait 14 days for refund Initiation. And after that 7 days need to wait for refund. Means 21 days customer has to wait. Their customer care executives given answers differently. Someone is telling something and someone is telling something. Very bad experience. How can they say like they are brand. Do not buy anything from this kind of company.
2023,5,"Gorgeous top, true to size"
2023,1,"Very bad experience. First gave welcome offer of 10% and then when i added items to wishlist,the coupon code became unapplicable. Dirty tactics for attracting consumers and mocking their honour."
2023,1,Dear h&m I order 24 june and today is 27 june my order is can't come to me. What I do to take fast my order. H&m say the package will be returned to the sender why?
2023,5,Easy to use app. Great notifications to sales.

2023,2,"Wrong items given. I'm not sure if they have eyes, but instead of slim blue jeans, they delivered me black slim jeans. How can they make such an avoidable mistake? I'm hoping I can make an exchange at the nearby H&M store. I love the brand, but this app is just ridiculous if the people working can't tell the difference between blue and black."

2023,1,"In the recent sale of 2+1, I ordered 6 items in two separate orders. The order was prepaid. Soon I got two mails from hnm, both saying exactly one item from each of the order was out of stock. I checked on the site, both items are still available in the size i ordered. I spent hours looking for stuff on that sale, then i spent hours talking to customer service. Ultimately they charged me full price for 4 items, and sent me a 20% coupon claiming the other two items were in bad quality. Scam."

2023,5,Awesome retailer. cannot go wrong by purchasing during sale 🤩
2023,5,user friendly
2023,5,"FALLIN IN LOVE with H&M ♥️ Affordable prices, good membership rewards, old clothes collection is rewarding too, exchanges are easy and its much better than other expensive brands which loot your pockets and the material also is not worth the price. H&M is worth every penny. I am a happy returning customer 🤷"

2023,1,Dåligt att man ej kan avända Klarna 30 dagar på grund av hög retur. om era storlekar hade varit mer pålitliga hade man inte behövt beställa fler storlekar. 👎👎👎

2023,1,The expearience on the app is very bad...in can you try placing order and tgen you need to fight with customer service for hours to get your own money back
2023,5,satisfied
2023,5,nice
2023,1,HM vill inte att kunder använder Klarna så de skäller på kunder för höga retur frekvenser eller någon annan anledning. Vilket dåligt beteende!
2023,4,Nice
2023,1,The app doesn't work anymore. It says it's caused by a systems app.
2023,5,hm is best
2023,1,Loves h&m products but hate this app. It just went blank when I was checking stuffs and sometimes we can't view also. Never faced such issues from other shopping sites
2023,4,thiss app is amazing
2023,1,"App doesn't start 9/10 times. Can't login when it does starts. Says incorrect id/password even when i put in the correct details. Have reset my password multiple times, nothing works. Unusable app."
2023,5,"i love quality of the product , and trendy designs"
2023,5,Great service!
2023,1,"Why announce ""member sale"" and then suddenly the member's location (that they've been ordering to for the last 3 years in a metropolitan center) is ""unserviceable"""

2023,3,Lowering you rate guys as feel you r not loyal to or care about your regular customers with this annual points reset. At least give some coupons or discounts for gathered points throughout the year. Shoes' quality got worse as well. Send back shoes after worn once as the whole sole just fell off. Nothing heard. Got in touch with customer service and was promised refund. Nothing received either Pls also put closer look pics to see what material and how it looks
2023,5,Nice.
2023,3,"always having trouble while placing order. App has been reinstalled multiple times. Phone has been changed, but this apparently happens in other account too. Checkout is the worst experience you can have with H&M app."

2023,5,Good fabric and price 😊
2023,5,affordable and nice brand
2023,4,ok

2023,3,Since latest update it's crashes all the time
2023,1,"If so much relies on apps and logins, do us a favour and get wifi in your stores."
2023,1,"Tôi đã đặt một đơn hàng hơn 1tr trên app, thanh toán bằng thẻ Visa. Khi nhấn nút ""Thanh toán"", tiền thì đã bị trừ khỏi tài khoản, nhưng đơn hàng thì lại không được xác nhận. Nếu anh chị giải quyết nhanh chóng cho trường hợp của tôi, tôi sẽ xem xét viết lại review app."
2023,1,Please fixed the signed in problem. Couldn't login the app.
2023,2,At first I love the clothe for every aspects of it but in the morning I saw a little hole below the neck button which is very very not acceptable.
2023,5,in ❤ with H&M products
2023,1,This app is full of so many bugs now I'm irritated by this app it takes too many time too refund and I'm going to uninstall it
2023,1,"Doesn't let you go past the ""set your region"" setup page."
2023,1,This app is so bad and products too
2023,1,"Experiența de utilizare e oribila. Dacă intru pe pagina unui produs din aplicațiecând vreau sa mă întorc la pagina de căutare sunt direcționată la o pagină de eroare. Asta face utilizarea aplicației imposibilă. Aplicația nu este deloc intuitivă, de ex reducerile pentru membrii sunt imposibil de accesat. Nu există o secțiune/ tab in care sa le accesez. Eu sunt logata în aplicație dar secțiunea care promovează reducerile de membrii îmi spune să mă înscriu. Nu are niciun sens."
2023,4,"overall good experience, but sometimes it shows items as available whereas they are not"
2023,5,great
2023,5,"simple, comfortable, yet super stylish and affordable clothes. quality as promised, always!"

2023,5,💗💗💗
2023,5,i loved the app
2023,1,Scam
2023,1,"Extremely disappointing app. I changed the address on the order I was placing, but the old/wrong address still came through to my PayPal payment. I was told the address could not be updated on the H&M system and. Only possibly with the delivery company later (I had tried this previously with the wrong address still being used). I could then only cancel the order, but negated all the discount codes I used with that order, making it more expensive for the next order I attempted to place."
2023,5,one of my favourite places to shop! They offer great incentives and the app is very much easy to use.
2023,1,"glitch, also support is not good. not trustable app"
2023,5,best
2023,1,Getting error message saying 'An important service is temporarily unavailable' so app won't open
2023,1,Worst delivery ever worst I should not even give 1 star
2023,5,The best!
2023,5,I love HM
2023,5,I love H&M. it is my favourite story ❤️
2023,1,It's not working
2023,5,Amazing app...
2023,2,App coming up in german! Even though i downloaded uk?
2023,4,"Awesome, just wish I could save items to multiple lists"
2023,1,😱😱 itna mehnga rate
2023,1,I registered my account in Singapore and I earned two vouchers when I donate unwanted clothes by scanning QR via the app last year. So then I continue to do the same thing yesterday. However I can't login to my account again in order to scan the code How come change to Malaysia market? And while Singapore market I can't login. I don't understand. It is I need register multiple accounts for different countries? And need to register by different email address. And I lost my vouchers too!
2023,1,Worst app literally the product quality are all good but not the refund system i returned an item the day i received it due to the size issue and it's been more than 40 days and still didn't get my refund and if you want to order the product of this app i recommend you to buy it from another sites if you want to get your money back... regretting every single time for using this app wish I could give it minus star
2023,5,Great product fast delivery
2023,5,amazing
2023,1,Completing online orders using the app rarely completes and requires redoing order numerous times. Not really sure what the issue is but I only have this trouble with H&M app purchases.
2023,1,Worst delivery method. I didn't even recieve a call from delivery people and now they are saying that the parcel is returning to the sender.i have never expericed this kind of unethical behaviour form such a brand.try to change the delivery partner or else you will lose so many customer just like me.
2023,1,I can't get into my acc
2023,5,awesome product
2023,4,good product

2023,5,naic
2023,4,gg bruh
2023,1,I had a very bad experience through this app. I ordered a dress for my sister but the size of the dress was big. So i returned the item. I recieved the dress on 30/4/2023 and i returned it on 2/05/2023. Till this date i didnt get my refund for the dress.
2023,5,very nice product 😊👍
2023,5,❤️
2023,3,"App is not easy to use, and there is not any option to track returns and payment by card or any online method always show some problems. Although I giving 3 star because it works."
2023,1,"Tried to log in, already had an account and tried to update my password several times and each time it said incorrect user name or password, can't buy stuff online if I can't log in 🙄"
2023,5,clothing material is very good
2023,5,Nice for shopping online 😄
2023,3,"I didn't have a good experience with H&M app, if someone is ordering something then you should give the exact delivery date or delivery day. Not 'Delivery expected within 2-7 days' it's a bad user experience. Instead you should have shown Delivery By so and so date Or Will be delivered on Monday, so and so date. Please consider my point."
2023,1,"Does not allow me to log in (I have android), the password is correct and I can log in on the web browser not in the app. So I cannot use app discounts. Edit: Still the update didn't help anything. Please solve it."
2023,1,App doesnt allow for membership signup. I cant do anything with it
2023,1,"Incredibly stupid to force customers to download the app to donate clothes ! I don't want the points but they don't let me unless I download the app. What's even worse is that I could not login to my account even I had reset my password 4 times, making sure that it is definitely correct. so I gave u0 and then just created an account. I ended up spent 30 mins for donating a small bag of clothes. I thought that H&M was a brand valuing sustainability but it turns out just a way of marketing."
2023,1,Very bad experience with the return and refund process for a month they are a big scam they don't really give you your money back calling the customer service they say we've initiated the refund but not received money from my side its better to by from some other brands
2023,1,Can't login in. Keeps showing me I have input the wrong password
2023,1,Unable to sign in. It's frustrating to use this app. Even payment gateway is terrible.
2023,1,"Multiple issues as of June 1st 2023. Not able to add items to favourites. Not able to add items to cart. App indicates there's an item in my cart, but when I open the cart it says that it's empty and gives an error message. The app is essentially unusable like this."
2023,5,superb
2023,2,The UI is exceptional to view but there are many bugs. Sometime I'm not even able to checkout
2023,1,"Ako ste iz Srbije, poštarina za bilo koju sumu je 490din, što je skuplje od svih ostalih, obično je besplatna preko 3000din, ili manja! Dobila sam ""popust"" 25% za haljinu, i onda dostava 490din. Znači nije 25%, farbanje čisto. I kupujte u drugim državama u h&m-u, jeftiniji su."
2023,1,I cant log in my account couple of times i tried to change my password they showed me incorrect password. Kindly fix the bug
2023,1,"App is so bad , most of time can't get in to it Keeps blocking itself . My points disappeared back to 0 . Membership discount won't appear at checkout when I eventually am able to get to it ."
2023,1,"Since the last 6 days, the order is under processing. It's not even dispatched. Very very slow. I got in touch with customer care. They are unable to help. 48hrs after order placement I am told it'll take another 48hours to dispatch. Today, after another 48hrs have passed, order is still under processing. Expect it to be cancelled immediately once it arrives"
2023,1,App is not opening
2023,1,"The shopping app throws an error when products are added to wishlist or even worse - cart. It's totally useless. Newest android version, one plus Nord 2t"
2023,2,"Why lately the App won't load and it's makes my.phone freezing, I had to restart the phone, but when I tried to open the app, then some problem repeat. In the end I a using browser instead of the app."
2023,5,Awesome
2023,5,"I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE, the app it's amazing 😍 for me as needed new clothethig for this new school year it's great. Has clothes in Different colors. And it shows everything there wearing so if you like somting there Wearing you don't have to look it up it's already there 👌as for me I have been shopping at H&M every time for back to school shopping 🛍️ If an outfit I put in my cart 🛒 it stock out it tells me so I can save it. The app is really easy to use to pricing is ok. I recommend this app a lot"
2023,4,Was happy with colour & material but felt the collar was too wide
2023,5,LITERALLH BUY ALL MY CLOTHES OFF HERE AMAZINGGG
2023,1,The customer care service is very bad. I talked with them yet still i didn't get my refund after almost a month
2023,1,Couldn't open for almost a week
2023,1,"Stupid app. I entered the correct password and email. Then changed the password, still can't enter my account while on the browser I can. Do not recommend and delete it."
2023,1,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE! Placed my order on April 9th, but never received it. Registered a case on 18th, then told me case resolution and refund initiation within 48, hours! NEVER HAPPENED. Called on 24th, told the same thing. Same on the 29th, May 7th, May24, and today as of May 30. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! Plus the customer care service providers won't connect over email! No responds to email either. No need to apologise, JUST GET ME MY REFUND! HORRIBLE"
2023,1,"Promises delivery within 3-5 days but actually takes 2 weeks. Good brand, sloppy service."
2023,2,"No wonder the fashion and quality is great here but the problem is payment! Everytime I do payment for my order some technical error happens and the amount gets debited but the order show payment pending, happened thrice with me !"
2023,2,usually I like this app but it does not let me log into my account now. It just freezes. I also try to add things to my cart and it said it's not able to with some error.
2023,5,Good
2023,5,"Bought 2 tshirt, nice quality and fitting."
2023,1,Vll heda h&m
2023,1,I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling to use it. It keeps freezing and shows me a blank screen when i try to open the app.
2023,2,It won't let me sign in 🙄
2023,1,"Έκανα online αγορά και παραλαβή από το κατάστημα. Από τα 5 προϊόντα ήθελα να επιστρέψω τα 2. Πήγα πίσω στο κατάστημα όπου και είχα παραλάβει αρχικά τα προϊόντα και μου είπαν ότι δεν γίνεται κι ότι πρέπει να πάω σε ταχυδρομική να τα επιστρέψω. Κακώς. Θα έπρεπε να τα δέχεστε κανονικά τις επιστροφές στο κατάστημα παραλαβής, όπως οι υπόλοιπες ανάλογες εταιρίες δέχονται κανονικότατα τις αλλαγές στο κατάστημα τους. Αντίο."
2023,4,Getting better
2023,1,Even the clothes are good app needs a lot of improvement. It wont let me login again. On forgot password after entering my same email id they say email sent but i never received it.
2023,1,Worst delivery service and return policy .if u return u r item its so hard to get back u r money
2023,1,Scan is not working on motorola
2023,1,"Unfortunately I had to uninstall the app multiple times as it keeps logging me out and with the new update I can't even log in. I cleared the cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, changed my password and nothing works. The app would also stop working and close itself mid way into trying to open an item. Pity, I have now lost 32 items in my shopping basket and I hope items are still available on the website."
2023,1,"In my first order, I bought 3 items but got 1 wrong item. Packing's great. They received my return and It's been 3 days. Still waiting for refund, It's taking too long, sigh. :("
2023,1,Such a big brand and yet it always gives wrong orders ..a big L to you H&M
2023,5,Great place to shop!🥰
2023,5,Best clothes and fabric
2023,1,"They have started sending duplicate products now and it's really surprising because they themselves are the parent company selling in India. It's not like I am ordering from a 2nd or 3rd party app like amazon etc. It's the Indian based h&m app! Wonder what the original owners,the Scandinavians, would think if they knew what was happening to h&m in India. A company that is more than 70 years old. It's just sad. Buyers beware!"
2023,1,There is no Refund even the product was returned it's more than 11 days no reply on mails no number to contact terrible experience
2023,1,Very very bad application. Infection it's one of the worst application
2023,1,"Awful, awful, awful app. Can't login to my account, even though I type in my correct username and password. I even changed my password to no avail. I'm so bored of it I've been shopping elsewhere. They've had plenty of bad reviews and they're not interested in doing anything about it. Losing lots of customers. Unacceptable."
2023,1,Never expect this from your brand ..I received a totally different product ..I got a different brand from H&M this is funny
2023,2,"Crashes constantly, they need to sort system bugs out"
2023,1,I cannot login to my account and it's sugar that the password was wrong. Meanwhile is can still use that password on web. Even after changing my password it doesn't work!!
2023,5,Loved it ❤️
2023,1,"Extremely poor delivery. If you have a store in your city/place please visit that. Do not under any circumstance pay Online always choose COD. Received delivery from China under 9 days, USA 13 days and H&M still waiting for local delivery 21+ days. Customer support is poor, it's evident that the agents are not trained well and they offer no solutions in most cases. It's an overall Disaster and headache if you order online from H&M."
2023,1,It stops time to time
2023,1,"Worst experience ever with the app. Even though I returned an order, they're not refunding the amount and am facing some issues in adding my bank details."
2023,5,❤️
2023,1,Shows error when trying to locate stores to check availability. Doesn't change billing address.
2023,1,"I recently had a terrible experience with the H&M app, and I feel compelled to share my frustration and disappointment. I placed an order for a pair of shoes on May 4th, specifically for a wedding party I was attending. However, not only did I not receive the product on time, but I also encountered a series of further issues that have left me utterly dissatisfied."
2023,1,I can't even log into the app
2023,1,Worst customer and delivery service. My order was supposed to be delivered by today and till now no updates from H&M and delivery agent. Such a pathetic care. It's always better not to use H&M app and the world's Pathetic & WORST delivery agent DELHIVERY
2023,1,Worst app always showing technical problem what is this everytime technical issues worst app ever can't even fill up acc information
2023,5,good shopping
2023,5,Good
2023,2,Keeps bugging- I can't delete or remove anything from my cart. It keeps coming back into it. Its annoying.
2023,1,F*** worst worst app ever . It doesn't even deserve 1 star anyways I guess only the clothes are good
2023,1,Love this store
2023,1,"Really very disappointed with H&M🙃 they say they'll deliver the order within 7days but it's been 11th day and they still haven't delivered my order. And the app is as terrible as the delivery system, I'm not even able to track my Order since 24 hours of ordering it's showing order is in Prossesing."
2023,1,Worst app.. Haven't received my refund yet...its almost 1 month now..ordered item was not send...phele they were so good...what happend now?
2023,5,Good
2023,3,Good
2023,1,ALWAYS A PROBLEM WHEN CHECKING OJT US8NG PAY IN 30
2023,1,Very bad experience.....i placed an order nd for some reason i returned it.......and i haven't received my money yet..... it's been really long..... never gonna order anything from h&m
2023,1,"I could not log in, already tried to uninstall and install for several times."
2023,1,Fix the technical issues
2023,1,"I am utterly dissapointed. I have been H n M fan for a long time now. I just bought a new track pant. I regret buying it so badly. The quality is very very far from good. I washed it as soon as I received it, didn't wear a single time and now it's loosing it colour."
2023,5,Very good clothing app ever
2023,1,"I have been trying to add my address and on Line 1 it keeps saying ""special characters not allowed"" when I only put in letters, no numbers or any punctuation marks. Can you fix this please? There's also no drop down list when I click on District. Another issue, ironically when the prompt to review the app showed up the app froze after I checked out an order. Definitely expected more."
2023,1,Why does it take so long for refunding process very dissatisfied with it Ordered something else was Delivered wrong item by them
2023,5,Love
2023,1,"Absolutely disappointing. Numerous errors in the payment section, the payments are approved by the bank, but the orders aren't registered. Also, customer service present a pathetic attitude, like I disturb them, zero interest to serve the customer, they don't even perform a check of the situation, the only solution is ""try later"". I'd rather go to the mall to buy clothes, than waste time in H&M call center or bank call center for unblocking amounts."
2023,1,When will I get refunded ?
2023,1,This update is worst. I have not been able to open the app since last 2 months. First the store was updating. Then suddenly it signed me out. After that not taking my id password. Reset mail is not coming on Reg. Email id. And on making a new account the country is not getting changed to India. It is only showing United Kingdom. Waste of time!
2023,1,"Not user friendly. People living in a particular European country might not speak that language. So you should have option for selecting Region, Language, Currency separately."
2023,1,Very disappointed with the app. Returned an order in October still did not get the refund with no answer from the customer care. Highly disappointed and won't recommend to anybody to buy online from h&m
2023,1,"Terrible app I ever had. Even I am in another country but want to use my native language but app DO NOT allow to use it. So bad on your localization! If u want to expand to global, you MUST LEARN about what is localization is. Besides, to the Dev team who build this app, please care about the speed of your app and the UI design, it's so inconvenient to find the scan session INSIDE the search icon. Bad design! And if H&M don't want the Android's users to use your app, just yell it out."
2023,1,"Pathetic. Cannot login into my account. Tried to change the password 3 times, and each time after completing all the steps, it keeps saying ""wrong e-mail or password"". Again, pathetic."
2023,4,"App freezing, i have to reinstall and my order is gone. 3่ times 2 weeks!!"
2023,5,Its vvvvvvvvvvvvv cool and good vv. Tready
2023,2,"Újra telepítés után nem enged belépni a fiókomba. A megfelelő belépési adatokat írom be. Online felületen be tudok lépni, viszont az alkalmazásban nem."
2023,4,Wonderful but not perfect
2023,1,"its been more than 7 days neither i have received the order nor i am able to check the order status on app. no one replies over Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. This was my first order via h&m app n probably the last"
2023,4,I love the fashion style but it's to expensive
2023,1,"I've downloaded the app on my new phone and I'm unable to log in. I've requested a password rest link and STILL have not gotten one. Yes, the email address is correct as they located my account in-store!! Very disappointing"
2023,2,I can't log into the app using my password (it says wrong password) I can however log in on the desktop using the exact same password that the app says is incorrect. Tried multiple times same problem keeps occurring.
2023,1,App not working currently. Update made and it says an important service is temporarly unavailable and app cannot work without it. Please try again lateral. There have been over 24 hours and îs still not working. Please resolve. Thank you
2023,2,I want exchange but it is not available
2023,1,I want to use the website but keep getting a singular ad advertising something I have no interest in yet doesn't give me the choice to exit the ad and actually access the site. What's the point?
2023,1,"Worst shopping app ever. I purchased a product from their site, the product I ordered came as usual, size and fit were genuine as shown in the app but I wanted a better fit so I returned the product and registered for refund, they picked it up but I haven't got my refund. Through email they said the transaction was failed but there's no further attempt been made by their site to contact me or ask for alternative bank details or UPI ID to refund the money back. Customer service is worst as well."
2023,1,Though it's a good clothing brand it's prabably the worst shopping app
2023,4,dziala i tyle 💪
2023,1,Long return process - I dont recommend
2023,1,"The application is flawed. Everytime I try to install and put my already saved password, it shows incorrect. And there's no response on mail when i tried to reset my password"
2023,2,"The app doesn't work properly anymore since the last update. It keeps blocking itself, it shows errors when I check the instore availability. The 3 fields that normally contain product description and further information under the pictures don't have a title anymore. I get errors when I try to save an item on the whish list. The app used to work perfectly fine until the latest updates. Please resolve these issues!"
2023,2,Not being able to sign in. Fix it please
2023,1,Cod service is really very very bad
2023,5,Nice store and app ☺️
2023,1,Refund not issued for about 5 months. Every time i call customer care they say we will refund you in 7 working days. NEVER BUY FROM THIS APP

2023,5,"Its very fashionable,very great app..."
2023,1,"Why can I not log into my account, even after resetting the password? Like resetting it wasn't hard enough. I literally had to keep trying several times because the link wasn't working and now, I still cannot access my HM account."
2023,1,Nothing make me want to shop more than unhappy lookin models ..
2023,5,Veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooddddd
2023,1,Unable to add anything to favorites
2023,2,The app won't let me heart anything. For months it's been an issue
2023,1,1 Mayıs'ta sipariş verdim kartımdan para çekilmiş ama sipariş falan yok müşteri hizmetlerine kesinlikle ulaşamıyoruz. Maillere cevap verilmiyor. Resmen param buhar olup uçtu. Sakın indirip alışveriş yapmayın paranız çöp olmasın.
2023,1,What is going on with you app? It's not working?
2023,1,Bad app
2023,1,"You people have nothing to do with bass, get the bass added, nonsense people"
2023,1,"I'm facing an issue trying to add the membership discount code. The code gets added in the cart. However, I see no discount being applied on my account."

2023,1,"I can't log in the app. I have to uninstall it and install it again before I can long in, which is so annoying."
2023,1,Your Commercials are AWFUL. Child slavery at it's finest. 50$ for linen pants is theft. Will NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM YOUR APP SOR COMPANY.
2023,1,"Please do not use this app, its a fraud, twice i purchased item using this app, the money was taken from my ACC, but there is no purchase order record or email from H&M, and you cant see nothing on the app about your purchase history."
2023,1,Horrible service. They use worst logistics partner for there delivery's. No return system. Pathetic phone support.
2023,5,"love H&M...we need a store in Kelowna!...so far shopping,shipping and satisfaction have been great...nice quality merchandise for affordable price and something for everyone...shopping instore is a must when visiting Calgary or Vanvouver!...Bring a store to Kelowna PLEASE!!! No longer opens on my phone...sadness"
2023,1,Payment section is very complicated and very hard to buy an item and get refund. please solve it ASAP.
2023,2,This app is impossible to use. I can't sign in because the email or password always seemed to be wrong even though I reset it like 3 times in a row and am pretty sure they're correct. It's also under maintenance more often than you need it.
2023,1,"Add a dark mode for Christ's sake! It's almost 2023!also older orders shouldnt be removed from history, since one might want to reorder sth."
2023,1,"It's not in english, only in magyar."

2023,5,Excellent.
2023,1,Its toooo highhh rateee😒😒
2023,1,Haylo don't like it
2023,1,This app always stops working whenever I go inside H&M store. Feels like it's done deliberately to make it more difficult to use points or return goods.
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,Just doesn't accept my profile. I have changed my pw multiple times.
2023,1,"It was worst experience because I ordered an Trouser but they send me 2 pairs of women's Trousers and when I was returning it they were not ready to accept that. Seriously,I can't believe H and M can do that . I was not expecting that kind of service from this app. I will recommend do not take the orders from the official store of H and M. I did not got any refunds. I was a clear fraud. (FRAUDS)."
2023,4,Nice app having wonderful clothes
2023,1,"For months, I haven't been able to log into the app. It allows me to enter my email and password, but not log in. I'm only able to log in successfully in the actual H&M website. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times but nothing worked."
2023,2,"Apps isn't work properly when I need to login to my accounts. I thought I put wrong password, but even after I reset to a new password it's just doesn't work."
2023,5,"Amazing app, I buy many clothes and they all have great quality!!!"
2023,1,Worst app ever i had came across. Unable to login in account
2023,4,Good qualitt refers but prices must be little bit low
2023,5,Good clothes good prices
2023,5,Best app
2023,1,Keep saying I entered wrong email and password??
2023,1,"I no longer buy from H&M because the courier left me the package that was supposed to arrive at the post office!!! and there is no way I pay him the commission when I place the order, he leaves it for me at the post office and I would have to go and pick it up at the post office !!! apart from the fact that they are not even very good things ... they are not signed things .... not worth it!!!! and I also have to go and get them from the post office and I would have to spend more money on petr"
2023,3,keeps deleting my items on the wishlist
2023,1,"the app doesn't have the function to scan voucher code, that only available in IOS version. Could not get the voucher for clothes recycling. Just a reminder to the development team, if you are adding new functionality, you need to add them to both IOS and Android."
2023,1,It malfunctions all the time . And I'm updated So annoying. Never had that before
2023,5,Perfect einfach nur gut
2023,1,"Cannot see my orders, cannot put an item to the loved ones, doesn't work properly the last days"
2023,1,I am not getting AED to place order in Dubai .
2023,1,This H&M glitch🙄😠... I tried to create accnt many times but app was saying that my gmail is invalid so I cleared the cache nd storage nd I created my accnt there nd also I ordered some sweatshirts and when I came back after an hour the app said to create account again... Wtheck... I tried to login but saying invalid.... So irritation 😬
2023,4,one of my fave brands
2023,1,Doesn't regocognise my current location
2023,5,I love your fashions Looking for new items
2023,1,"I'm disappointed with no exchange option, I had to cancel the order and let go my discount coupon."
2023,5,Amazing clothes and new attractive accessories
2023,1,No refund yet it's been more than 15 days🥲
2023,1,Worst shopping app.
2023,1,"My refund is still half done,and it's taking way too long"
2023,5,"I've been a loyal customer of H&M, and I must say that their app has made shopping so much easier and convenient for me. Not only does the app have a wide variety of trendy clothes and accessories at affordable prices, but their customer service is exceptional. Whenever I have a question or an issue, their team is quick to respond and provide helpful solutions. Plus, the easy returns process is a game-changer! I highly recommend the H&M app!"
2023,1,"👎 You'll be able to log in one day, then they'll make a change that makes the same email address you've been using ""invalid"" so that you lose access to your entire account and you're forced to create a new one. 👎 Also, the app doesn't work if you have a VPN"
2023,1,This app is very worst i can't even sign in 🤦
2023,5,This app is amazing bc I always see the newest collection every single time when one comes out and I love point collecting 💕
2023,5,Love dresses
2023,1,Worst price
2023,5,Very nice
2023,1,"They need to fix their app, i put in my username and password to login, then i hit the login button and nothing happen.. so the login button is a dummy button. ??? I don't get it.."
2023,1,"You people need to fix this app. I have tried to make two different purchases and every time I put in card information without clicking complete order, you guys were quick to take the money out but the order never went through on your side. There is no order pending or past order. Twice I had to call my bank to decline the purchase since it NEVER shows on your side and you aren't able to help."
2023,1,"Had a problem with logging in to my account for a long time through the app, even though I have keyed in the correct email and password. I contacted customer service to assist me in the problem and they were not helpful in solving my issue as they only told me to reset my password, uninstall and install the app, clear cache etc. I have reset my password probably a 100 times by now and done all the troubleshooting methods recommended by them and still no luck. Worst app ever."
2023,3,The quality is great but why do they take so many months to restock
2023,1,Quality was very nice 👌
2023,1,"App stopped functioning properly after the last update. App won't let me select different colors or sizes. Plus, it is impossible to put an item in my shopping basket and check out! 🤡 Finally, ever since H&M orders are handled by another delivery service, the shopping experience has NOT improved: 1. It takes forever to arrive (2-3 weeks). 2. You have to install an app of this delivery company to make arrangements. 🤯 🤦🏻 It's inconvenient and it takes too much bloody time."
2023,5,My fav
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,Couldn't change language stupid app
2023,1,I can't seem to order the product it gets stuck at delivery. There seems to be a bug.
2023,1,Worst. Ever
2023,1,It's been more than 34 days since I haven't receive my refund and when I reached out for customer service I was told that I haven't updated my bank details and I've entered my name only but how is this possible because we cannot save those form unless we enter everything and I have a screenshot of my bank details being filled and saved. I'm sure there's a technical issue with the app.
2023,4,H&M is just a good app
2023,3,"TIME WASTING WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIMES YOU ASKING US TO SIGN IN , OVER AND OVER AGAIN. TIRING."
2023,1,"It's pretty awful, the screen turns white and I have to restart the app."
2023,1,Didn't let me register when I was in the store. Waste of time.
2023,5,Amazing
2023,1,"It's been a month didn't get my refund of a product, not even get any proper response from hnm, given phone number doesn't work...."
2023,1,Things getting reset before you can earn points
2023,1,It takes forever to launch! Sometimes doesn't launch at all! All this in very high speed internet.
2023,1,Horrible customer services. I returned a product and no Refund was given to me. Nobody even listens to your issues on call. They are so rude . Pathetic service
2023,4,Nowadays delivery are late than usual 🙂
2023,4,Good experience
2023,1,not possible to log in
2023,3,Would help if there was actually a signal in stores to load up the app!

2023,1,Not bad but not good
2023,1,This app totally sucks it's the worst shopping app . To deliver a item it takes a month or more . Please don't buy from this ducking stupid app ever 🤮
2023,1,"Unistalled. You can't use this if you don't have a credit card. Very matapobre ang dating. Buti pa ang UNIQLO, merng COD payment option"
2023,1,App keep crashing once i enter and clicked on a category. Clearing storage/cache does not fix the app
2023,1,"Doesn't enable me to like items , when I select the heart an error occurs."
2023,1,"Unable to sign in, have tried through multiple email IDs, I'm unable to sign into the application.. asked about the same at the retail outlet, they couldn't fix it.. tried to log in over wifi network and on phone network.. tried to uninstall and reinstall.. tried to change the passwords still unable to sign in, i keep clicking on sign in after entering my details it just freezes right there and won't move ahead."
2023,4,Good
2023,1,Very worst app in payment terms
2023,5,operation
2023,2,App keeps on closing
2023,3,"Introduce more fabrics, colors & styles. Please manufacture pima cotton leggings & pima cotton T-shirt for women."
2023,5,J'aime trop cette application il y a to us ce qu'on aime et ce qu'on veut
2023,2,"I'm using a dark theme on my phone, and I can't see any of the navigation menu items - both the background and the text is white. The only item visible in red is the current view."
2023,5,this is a very convenient app!
2023,1,No option to change country/ market
2023,1,Worst online shopping experience ever
2023,5,Over power 💪⚡
2023,1,Don't work
2023,1,"Pathetic service, won't shop again"
2023,1,"Pathetic experience with H&M placed an order, amount got deducted, no confirmation of the order, called the customer care they said, due to some reasons the order got cancelled and i ll get the payment back, then i placed an order for COD, i even created an account but later when i went back to track the order i was unable to log in to my account even after changing the password, such a Pathetic app. Are you people even goin to return my money ?"
2023,2,I couldn't change my address or the location it was set in default (uk) from start I tried to change it but I couldn't
2023,3,Good overall but keeps sending me emails
2023,1,1. Why can we only wishlist 60 items 2. The app resets the data in few months where wishlisted items and order history are lost 3. After the latest update there's no share button
2023,1,"Worst app. The service is even worse! If you have to return anything, just forget about your money. You will never get refunded"
2023,1,Worst customer service and return policy..not satisfied
2023,1,Apps worse . Already enter new password. But say wrong password n email ? Big brands with worse app dev ? I don't understand
2023,5,Excellent
2023,3,Wieso kann man nicht mehr nach Konzept filtern? Die App wird so unnutzbar für mich! Bitte wieder einführen!
2023,1,"I need the app to become loyal customer and use some discounts, but when you try to do this after login, the button ""become loyal customer"" just don't work."
2023,1,"H&M is quite popular brand. Please upgrade on the app and online user experience. If they put in more effort on their online shopping. Honestly, I feel super disappointed about their app."
2023,5,Nice
2023,2,The UI/UX of the app is not at all optimized and it is definitely not a user friendly one. Tried to order for a new address but the checkout page continued to show the older address. Please invest in optimizing the app experience
2023,1,"H&M is not able to manage the logistics at all. Everytime you order anything there is a payment related issue. I returned some items and they did not refund my money. I ordered another product and paid through UPI but the delivery person also took cash from one of my family members on delivery. It has been 2 months already but H&M is not even trying to resolve this issue. I raise complaints and they just close them without resolution. Don't order through this app, you'll be risking your money."
2023,1,Worst app I have ever used...I have returned my order one week back ..still it's staus is showing as delivered...no refund is paid to me...and also they have send completely diff product.
2023,1,It's been so long and yall haven't gotten your membership bug fixed?
2023,4,Best App
2023,2,DONT BUY FROM APP it is a pain to get your refund..they take 5 days for just getting back that is if you call them..it's been over 15 days..there is a glitch at their end..and I have no update on where my refund is...they can't give store credit or reverse in app account..So u r stuck waiting for them..n if ur refund does go thru then it's still 30days to show..where r they living when everyone else takes 7 days.. extremely disappointed..n not gonna shop online
2023,2,The customer care sevice is just worst.
2023,1,Payment gateways are a pain. Adding an alternate address is a hassle. Such a useless app.
2023,1,"A brand like this didn't meet my expectations. Continous technical glitches. I placed an order and within few days from the order, viola! the app doesn't work. I keep trying to open the app but it is just a blank page with only the H&M logo."
2023,1,App has gone after last update. It shutters a lot and it has no 120hz scrolling.
2023,1,I can't even log in.
2023,3,Updated the app and now I'm unable to log in. Frustrating.
2023,1,"App does not login ..i tried to reinstall it, but still it was not logging in. Didnt expect this from H&M"
2023,3,Quality is so so but prices are cheape
2023,1,"Why are you locking my account for nothing. That's dumb, no normal service, no 5 stars."
2023,5,Exactly what I was looking for so long
2023,1,can't swipe to see the rest of the size chart
2023,1,Not user friendly app
2023,1,Poor customer support. My money was debited 5 times and was returned only 4 times. I wrote an email to them but there was no reply. I am still waiting for my refund.
2023,4,"There's a bug, app freezes/closes when searching for 'turtleneck' in the Mens department."
2023,5,Tricoul pe care l am comandat a fost super smecher.A rezistat mult și schiar mi aplacut.100 de stele pentru aceasta aplicație superba(da mi 2 puncte)
2023,4,Very good and easy order replacement and good quality close love it but i didn't like the hoodie quality
2023,1,Can't able to place order!? Please rectify the problem.
2023,4,Bruh pls fix the select delivery method glitch.
2023,5,🥰🥰
2023,1,The app has too many technical errors when it comes to payments and returns. The customer service is very very bad.
2023,5,LOVE IT. ❤️
2023,3,Perfect for budget
2023,3,"I love the app! It's something that is simple and easy to use to shop your site. Lately, for like the past month or two, I haven't been able to save any pieces to my saves, it keeps saying ""error."" It's just very frustrating!"
2023,1,Worst shopping app ever. Services provided are pathetic. I placed the order successfuly and after a week I got the email that my order is cancelled. Contacted customer service but no solution provided. Wasted time and money.
2023,1,Delivered wrong and defective item (it was torn). Did not expect this from H&M.
2023,5,great app!!! i love the clothes :) very cute but its a bit pricey but ig its wotth it !
2023,3,Ý²2s4s²
2023,5,Very good
2023,1,Can't login to the app which makes the app unusable
2023,5,I'm very happy with my shopping
2023,2,No doubt with the quality and discount. So I gave 2 star. But often the favorite products are out of stock or the size is not available. So I end up not shopping with them. Please restock products too.
2023,1,worst experience. it automatically cancelled my order after few days. Instead of buying from here buy from other app like ajio and all because these compay can't affort delivery.
2023,5,Nice clothes
2023,4,Wow but need to be added few thing that are in other countrys like southpark shirts
2023,1,"I ordered a tshirt from here and i got the wrong size and i am trying to return it from the day one but i don't know they did something i can't return it . every time website shows error and i talked to helpline chat for more than 50 time i guess, everytime they say it will take 3 to 5 days but still no progress"
2023,5,Best
2023,5,i love their clothes i just love them
2023,4,Nice
2023,2,Unable to login ...nothing happens when submit hit and doesn't present save password from Google manager for speedy access
2023,3,"Wipes out my favourites if I do not open app for some time, even items in stock. Also wipes out items in the shopping bag. This happens frequently. I have been adding items repeatedly for several times already and that us really disturbing experience."
2023,5,Mind blowing Purchase on Second order 🙂💥🔥🔥🔥H&M forever ♾️
2023,1,The username and password works fine in Pc and mobile browser. But the app doesn't allow to login. Displays wrong password Error.
2023,1,Good product Worst app.. I was supposed to get 10% membership discount but during checkout it shows discount not applicable. Not recommending anyone.
2023,1,"As with others,horrific app. Logged me out. Have changed passwords and if I open a new account I lose all benefits. Sale is on in app and not online. Incredibly frustrating"
2023,3,Very slow
2023,5,it's an amazing app. the quality of its products is pretty good and it's customer care service pretty good as well. I feel very comfortable to use this wonderful app.
2023,5,Best collection in reasonable prices
2023,1,providing worst customer services and not ready to return back customer's valuable money
2023,5,Amazing
2023,1,clothes are always out of stock in h&m and they never restock them again. please restock the clothes i need to buy them. H&M needs to do sales and discounts more often
2023,1,Bad app india country is not there
2023,1,I can't log in on this app. Can't enjoy my membership priviliges
2023,5,love this app!
2023,5,Good
2023,5,🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
2023,4,Best
2023,5,H&M is my second home. I love recycling clothes here and get amazing discounts as a reward. So cool.
2023,1,Worst experience. Everything about this app and their service is BAD. Never order from this app if you want to save your money.
2023,5,Easy!! ❤️
2023,4,Please add cancel order option
2023,5,Trust worthy
2023,2,"Heeft een tijdje goed gewerkt, ik zag alleen prijzen die niet meer geldig waren, daarom zojuist update uitgevoerd, nu zijn er 3 dropdown opties bij elk product, zonder titel, en daarin staat info die eerst direct zichtbaar was.."
2023,1,Worst app but their quality is very good
2023,1,Worst app ever
2023,1,de la ultimul update nu poti verifica stocul din magazine. gunoi
2023,5,Gsb
2023,1,"Cannot login anymore, it does not accept a + in the emailaddress anymore. Therefor I cannot login anymore with my emailaddress that has a ""+"" in it. Frustrating UX due to incomplete UI testing."
2023,1,The app doesn't work since February. I can't make an order.
2023,1,Charged 3 times. Order is not confirmed. What is this app about.
2023,5,Good
2023,1,Hm is a good brand but the app is very worst
2023,1,"I tried for many times to enter this app on my phone when I was buying things in store. App didn't remember me, I couldn't enter it. Can't find my points that I earned over these years. N on top of that didn't buy things in store cuz I felt bad for my points n this app malfunction"
2023,4,Ok
2023,4,It was a good application...but for the past 3 days I'm not able to.open it I cannot access 😫😑😩9
2023,1,The absolute worst app and pathetic services they provide.
2023,1,"The most worstest online purchase, I have ever experienced."
2023,1,ITS HORRIBLE LIKE BRANDS LIKE THAT USE HORRIBLE LAYOUT WEBSITE AND APP... APP EVERY TIME LOGOUT ME HAHA SO ITS AUTOMATICALLY UNISTALL TRASH... SERIOUS IF YOU WILL BE TRUST STIUPID DESIGNERS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE HOW YOU WANT SELL PRODUCT IT WILL BE SHORT STORY FOR THIS BRAND ITS WORST AND WORST THE WORST ONE IZ ZARAH HOOORIBLE WEBSITE I GUESS WORST ONE IF CLIENT WANT FIND SOMETHINK OK THX!
2023,2,Refund process is very slow😓. I got my refund after 10 days.
2023,1,Why is the account on website and not accessible on the app. I can't see my orders in the app version and can't even login my account. Also I can't find the returning product on the return section. it's making me anxious. Hope i get the refund safely. The return feature is thrash 1. We can't exchange the order 2. Suppose we are budget tight. Reordering after returning the unfitted sized clothing is a mess. It takes so much time to get refund and reorder get shifted quicker than returner
2023,1,This app has many bugs....i am disatisfied
2023,3,Had a very bad experience. I have returned my parcel minimum 2 weeks ago. Still i didn't get my refund
2023,1,Unable to change and update Login account.

2023,1,Haven't rcv my refund yet it's been a monts worse experience ever didn't expect this type behavior from h&m back my money ASAP after receiving my money I'm going to unstall this app
2023,4,Great deals at low price
2023,2,"Não há opção de recolha gratuita em loja. Não vale a pena pagar mais de portes do que o preço das peças. Também não me deixa fazer login, nem me envia códigos para alterar a senha. É impossível fazer compras na H&M."
2023,5,Nice looking for boys hnm
2023,1,"Trash app, I simply cannot sign up as a member. Nothing happens when u press become a member button."
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,"This is literally the worst app, every freaking time I open it I'm logged out and guess what I can't even log in with the same Id I have to create a new account Fixxx thisss shittt!!!!"
2023,4,Tracking is very inaccurate and the app needs to be more optimisatize so 4 stars for that
2023,5,VGood appp
2023,1,Worst experience with customer service. No immediate response.
2023,1,"App is terrible. Stock displayed on app, doesn't reflect what is actually in store and you can't order from another store. Not gonna bother ordering from here again."
2023,1,Horrible website. Can not even search 4 womens bathing suits.
2023,5,Ce mai buna aplicatie! Mi-am luat un hanorac și materialele sunt de foarte buna calitate.
2023,1,They use Korean models to sell clothes in India market. Either clothes are outdated coming from Korea or they think Korean models are better than Indian. Deserves less than 1 star
2023,1,I can't log in! The screen goes blank giving me zero options. I tried to uninstall and install again - the same result! Fix it!
2023,5,Bohut badiya
2023,1,No option to swap between saved delivery addresses. You have to edit the last used delivery address manually.
2023,2,"Würde da nicht bestellen vorallem nicht mit Klarna da dort jedes mal 2-4 Werktage steht ich jedoch bis zu 3 Wochen mal warte und die 1 Monat vom Klarna dann schon abgelaufen sind und ich es direkt Zahlen muss, echt unverschämt."
2023,2,Keeps logging me out and won't let me log back in. Had to make a new account and itndid it again
2023,1,How can H&m sell tiran dress? Even though the product is return I haven't received my money back yet.and the customer care no seems to be a fake as I'm unable to connect to anyone
2023,5,"Best clothing shopping experience. The quality is 100%best ,U guys must use it. I hv been using h&m for 3 years now."
2023,1,Useless app... Debited money from account but order still stuck at cart
2023,1,Keeps showing out of stock!😡
2023,1,The app is not at all user friendly. I'm unable to edit my billing address. Why give edit option if you won't allow. Got frustated & unintalled.

2023,1,I have a flagship device and the app is so sluggish it's impossible to use
2023,2,"First time to use the app. The app loads fast but I cannot click the ""Become a member"" button. Not sure why, there was no message or anything."
2023,2,They are not able to solve one return issue from the past 15 days. Worst customer service.
2023,4,Love the app .. and all the perks of being able to shop from h&m from home but the only issue is with returns.

2023,3,Really weird set up in my opinion
2023,1,"Heyy H&M Earlier the ur brand provided very good quality products but as time goes on ur products r deteriorating in quality, hoodies, sweatshirts, joggers, trackpants everything get lint so quickly, n gets discolored after 2 3 washes...please do something about it or else u r gonna loose clients in time"

2023,1,I have the worst experience of any app till today.Its more than 2 months and I didn't get my refund.Anyone who are not sure about their size plzz never order from this app.They always told me that I will get my refund in one week and whoosh it's 2 months now.Never expect this from an international brand.

2023,1,I can't login.
2023,2,The products are good but the return and refund system are not at all good..its been more than a month and I haven't received my refund. Customer service dose not really help much with that. Not really trustable company for refunding system!
2023,1,Worst shopping experience. They cancelled the order after 3 days for no reason and I haven't got my refund till now.
2023,5,Best app
2023,1,"Worst app , Don't shop in this app Worst customer service I still didn't receive my REFUND after returning my order. I want my refund....!!!"

2023,5,Very nices cloth for men
2023,1,I became member of hn m but they didn't give me discount . Nor the app is working. I can't complain as they don't have that facility. Very disappointed with your service in Germany. Please don't be fooled you do t get discount here.
2023,5,I only use this app for recycling clothes for money off in store.
2023,3,Good service
2023,3,Good

2023,5,H&M is a good brand. Its gives good quality clothes very good for middle class family.
2023,1,Disgusting took my money and no refund scam app
2023,1,"App crashes all the time. I placed orders, they took my money, but the order wasn't confirmed. My money still blocked."
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,It doesn't let me login to my account

2023,1,Worst
2023,1,Fast fahion i understand but What is wrong with the quality of the materials colour fades in couple of washes . Hate the materials
2023,1,Unable to login
2023,1,I revised my review- I am unable to connect even if I reset my password twice.
2023,5,Hope so good
2023,1,Very very bad app and the clothes are also too bad their colours are too fade and size comes always wrong. And they are taking too much time to return it. Don't download this app!
2023,1,"I had returned a product and they did not refund my money.They say that ma'am sometimes something goes wrong in between the return process, either the product doesn't reach us or we receive a Non H&M product and we can't help,we don't refund in that case . Its not our responsibility after we hand it over to the pickup boy,its not in the hands of the innocent customers if something goes wrong in between the return process and they easily says that we can't help with that,we won't refund. FRAUD!"
2023,3,"The app is ok for the most part, there are some issues with products dissaprearing from the saved items list. Also when I mentioned this to customer service they didn't seem to care or send this concern further... it's a bit of a shame because I like the clothing and I would defineteley spend more if the app would work better ..."
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,I can't see the videos. Each product video stops at the beginning. Worst experience 😞😞😞
2023,1,Shittiest app ever. It gives you error while logging in even with correct email and passwords. When send a forgotten password request its doesn't even send you an email. It's impossible to get through. High priority high severity error. Goodluck testers.
2023,1,"I had a terrible experience with this app. I ordered a khaki sweatshirt worth Rs. 1000 on the app. Within a few days I received my parcel, and a delivery boy asked me to pay Rs.900 only. Surprisingly it was of another color. So the other day I returned it. They have mailed me that refund is processing but it's more than 25 days now. Still, they didn't take any action. I have called customer care so many times but they are just saying that U will get it I have also mailed them,but no response"
2023,1,Worst app i have ever seen never try to install and order things very bad service though the products are good I'm disappoint with it 👎👎
2023,5,Easy to order and use ...
2023,5,🧡
2023,1,False advertising at its finest. Scam
2023,5,Easy to use and fast shipment
2023,5,Best style
2023,5,🤌
2023,1,"This app recently launched in Singapore and its members day so everyone is signing up and trying to get the discount (me included). The app was super buggy. The member ID doesnt appear, thus i cant even scan it. The staff on site were trying their best to help everyone but its friday night so the queues were pretty long. I decided to forgo the discount in the end, since the staff were overwhelmed. Please do a test run before launching."
2023,1,No bar code for my membership so i dont get any benefits. Lousy for this day and age. Should close down singapore stores lol.
2023,1,You guys are so pathetic that you abuse your workers. Will never ever buy anything from you & will not let my know ones buy too!!
2023,5,"Good, but need some fashion"
2023,1,I have returned one product which i purchased from online . They did not refunded me and after 2 months they say i have sent non h&m product. I asked them evidence which they do not have. H&M instead of telling lies you would have told that you require money i would have let it go.....worst service
2023,2,"There's a huge problem with the app. Once u log in for the first time it's all fine. But later when u try to open, it asks u to sign in again and when u try to do that.. it either says wrong email ID or password. Even after you change your password using forgot password method, it still says the same. I hope the tech team rectifies this."
2023,5,One of my Favorite stores to shop at
2023,5,"Bro its return process is so good. Sometimes there is a technical issue but it gets fixed automatically in less than a day.paecel ki condition bhi ek dam badiya hoti hai.or sayad hi itne offers and coupons koi or shopping app deta ho. It is a bit expensive but if you wait, the offers keep coming.And parcel also arrives in 3 and 4 days...sorry it takes maximum 4 days🙂... i will not talk about the QUALITY of h&m because everyone knows that's why you guys have visited here.... LOT OF LOVE ™H&M❤️"
2023,1,Worst website I'm trying to login and still nothing is happening
2023,5,Great app to buy jeans and one of my favourite shopping apps
2023,1,"I just got a call from H&M saying that they had credited my account for the order I returned but its not showing in my account even after 24 hours. Their customer service is also the worst, not able to contact them and there is no chat option and they don't reply the emails. Never expected this from H&M."
2023,3,I have a problem my wishlist gets disappear if I open the app after sometime it's really annoying please solve this problem it's been more than 2-3 times
2023,5,Super
2023,1,No hay congruencia entre la aplicación y las tiendas físicas.
2023,5,"Hello H&M...! Mostly all of the T-Shirts I wore are from your brand. And it'll be more awesome if the T-Shirts of all borders/collars are thicker and have more quality. REASON ""all the borders/collars of the neck area gets curly and looks old after washing once or twice. Overall fantabulous...!"
2023,5,Awesome 😎
2023,1,I ordered a medium size product and got a small size with fake medium size tag.....will never Buy from this site.
2023,1,"This is the worst shopping app I've ever used. I've ordered from it twice, and both times the order was delayed. The second time, when I ordered the wrong item, it was delivered, and when I returned it, they told me they would process the refund when I asked for it the first time. However, after 9 days had passed, they still hadn't escalated my question, so when I asked again, they did. Worst ever shopping app."
2023,5,Love to shop at H&M
2023,1,Very bad experience worst worst 👎 shopping app
2023,5,"Love it so much, the best clothes for my baby, myself and even for my 67 year old mama! Great app, but sometimes getting stuck, still reveiwing as 5/5!!"
2023,5,Nice
2023,2,it doesnt let me log into the app
2023,1,"Major signing in issues guys, it has been there for months and I've never been able to collect my points"
2023,5,easy to use
2023,1,I'm not able to sign in to my account it's been 3 months and I've tried everything and talked to the customer service but still not working.
2023,1,This app has lost it's dignity. I have paid twice for the cloth... which was a technical glitch from their side. They said my money will be refunded...but now it's going to be a month... whenever I call them...they keep extending days and days....not providing my refund back . WORST experience. Didn't expected from this app.
2023,1,Worst service...even after multiple calls And follow up didn't receive my refund for double payment for the order...such a disappointment
2023,1,"Everything is out of stock, it was one of my favourite brand! Now every item i like is unavailable. Sizes are unavailable."
2023,1,"Can't login. After u key in all the details correctly, and press login button, it just stays there without any reaction... Nothing at all.."
2023,1,"""H&M's App Misses the Mark on Sustainability"" This company claims to promote sustainability, but the reality doesn't match the image. Factory workers in Bangladesh producing clothing for H&M are paid low wages in poor conditions. The company's use of recycled materials is not enough to offset the environmental impact of production and transportation. The sustainable image is simply a marketing tool, not a reflection of reality. Don't be fooled by their empty promises."
2023,1,Stupid error with payment!!!!
2023,2,"Why has H&M started taking forever to deliver the orders offlately? Does anyone has any clue? Also, they are too slow in refunding customer's money."
2023,5,Good
2023,1,"Po każdej aktualizacji lista ulubionych znika, trzeba wyszukiwać na nowo."
2023,3,good app
2023,1,No me aceptó el pago y en ninguno de mis dos cobros desde diferentes tarjetas
2023,1,"Very poor. Had a 15% time limited offer, won't accept either of the codes and it is supposed to be auto applied at checkout, which it isn't. Don't pressure sell if the trigger doesn't work! Filters aren't great either, brings back all sizes even when oit of stock."
2023,5,Excellent design and very good delivery 👏
2023,1,"Couldnt agree more with the other comments saying that this is the worst shopping app ever. Might as well just turn this into a ""window shopping"" app rather than an actual online shopping app. I could rate this as a 0 if possible! Such a hassle!"
2023,5,Best brand...
2023,1,DO NOT USE THIS APP. The refund/return process is painfully slow. Pathetic customer service. Refund and returns are terribly delayed and the customer service never provides any solution to the queries raised.
2023,5,I love H&M!♥♥♥
2023,1,"The app has been broken for over a week now, I've uninstalled and re downloaded it and it's still broken and not working. Really disappointed to be honest as it'sy favourite shop, I've not been able to collectember points in store or only shop on the app."
2023,1,"The app doesnt let me acces the special prices for members, it always tells me to log in although I am already logged in."
2023,3,Stubborn
2023,3,Bad service....cancel my order
2023,5,Nice 🙂
2023,1,I experienced hnm app for the first time And it was really bad Firstly the product I got 1st cloth was torned and 2nd one was not as showen in the picture it look way more bad then the picture Secondly I got problem form the app I returned both the item but no return tracing was their After returning them still it shows the same ( product delivered) when the item delivered And also i dont know anything about my refund because the app didn't ask me about where to refund or what policies are
2023,5,Please cancel ALL ADS
2023,5,Good with some purchases
2023,5,Nice
2023,2,Money drawn and no purchase was confirmed. Had to address the problem to customer service
2023,5,Very good app
2023,5,Very good app
2023,5,Shopping for a new and upscale or more unique wardrobe??? Download the H&M app today and start sparking up your closet!!
2023,5,"Luv Luv Luv H&M Excellent Wuality Clothing, Returns no problem, they used to BUY clothes from their Clients! The clothing (I don't know if H&M still buy clothing?) has to be in top shape and good quality!"
2023,5,So far I'm satisfied from service to products. Customer service is very friendly and will help you till to satisfactory of what's the Problem is. Great job! Very satisfied customer here 😉
2023,2,Downloaded app to become a member and won't let me join.
2023,5,Cool
2023,1,Points all disappeared. Buggy app.
2023,1,"I have not received my refund yet inspite of my product being picked up . The chatbot and customer care service is pathetic they waste your time by asking details about you but at the end the outcome of the call is zero . Such a big brand doing such nuisance , not expected ."
2023,5,Ilove it
2023,1,Glitches
2023,5,Love it
2023,1,Did not get anything for shopping 😞
2023,1,Please restock some of the women slides early as possible....
2023,5,Good app
2023,5,This is not mostly about the app but the products.The garments are super stylish and comfortable though they are not very unexpensive but they justify their price tag.The shades happen to be more aesthetic than being funky therefore good for a change.
2023,1,I'm not able to sign up even after entering mail id and password I have clicked on sign up multiple times but it is not responding
2023,1,Not affordable for me ths app
2023,5,Best sale💯🔥
2023,1,"Worse and poor,,, Always out of stock,,cant believe it...waiting for restock more than a months but still not instock yet,,"
2023,1,"Had ordered a black gilet in size S but the site sent me one in size M, had returned the product but refund has still not been initiated from their side, it has been almost a month now...made numerous calls as well but till now no effort from their side..."
2023,2,Refund process is very time consuming. Customer service is also not that good coz hardly anyone picks up the call. I'll be highly grateful if u could refund the amount quickly or atleast tell the time by when it will come.
2023,5,Sooo good colletion
2023,5,Good best brand and staff Kritika
2023,5,"In store mode, please bring it back in the UK app. Many thanks"
2023,1,"Although the app in itself is good, no complaints but there are far too many trackers for ads, always running in the background so maybe Update with a little less trackers and its all good"
2023,2,For some reason I can't log into my account from the application anymore. I tried to change password and delete and install application again but nothing helps
2023,1,Worst app . First they took my return and there was no information regarding that and when I called them for my refund they are saying ki we have cancelled you return so there is no chance of pickup and refund . And when I contacted there customer service there are is no intiative .
2023,5,Lovly
2023,1,"Worst experience. Don't purchase from h and m , you will get neither a good quality product nor you can return it."
2023,2,H&M not giving actual 50-70% discount....it's just giving it on leftover 10% Stock or item.... this stock available at entry only..
2023,1,Sovellus ei päästä enää sisälle. :')
2023,4,"Sometimes you can't add items to your favorites because of a bug but you can add them to cart and then to your favorites. You can't create folders for your favorites. After some time all of you cart and your favorites are erased. Other than this, the app is good and easy to use, also the products have a pretty good quality for the price you pay, so I'm quite satisfied."
2023,1,Please dont support this brand from sweden because they dont respest islam religious thank you
2023,1,Worst app ever! Doesnt respond to your email nor does it refund your money.
2023,1,"I type my log in details in and click 'log in' and nothing happens, no matter how much a spam the log in button, no error codes either"
2023,4,Thanks you 🙏
2023,3,"When paying via PayPal it takes you through the motions of logging in and payment etc, then seems to take you to a web version of the store via the app and have to start again with payment, but it doesn't work. Have to delete the app and order online from a browser which is really annoying."
2023,3,The scanner doesn't work on my new phone to get coupons
2023,1,One of the worst app i have ever seen in my whole life. Ordered hoodie for event and after 7 days it get cancelled later showing refund will be done within 30days. It's very slow and boring process. You have to wait for everything here. Don't go for such worst app that would be my suggestion...
2023,1,Quran in our hearts
2023,1,Respect our quran.
2023,1,Has not opened in days. Keeps saying the app is bugged. Some key component is not working essentially. Uninstalling and reinstalling has had no effect and there doesnt seem to be a repair option.
2023,1,The prices r good
2023,1,I can't log in!!! The Samsung pass won't let me put my password in the app but its only this app . Therefore i keep getting locked out and cannot access my h&m account and receipts etc.
2023,1,XL and XXL size isexactly same for hoodies. What the hell is going on. Just changing the tags. Pathetic services.
2023,1,loser country of Sweden 🇸🇪
2023,1,Chor hain saale ... Return karne pe paise kha jaate hain... Bastards 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😛
2023,1,The worst app i have ever used like you guys have the worst delivery service and the catch is you are never gonna even receive your order like seriously 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
2023,4,Good apps
2023,1,"La peor aplicación de tienda departamental que e usado. No deja hacer compras, ya lo intente 3 veces y me aparece un error, pero si me quitan el dinero de mi tarjeta (que después tengo que esperar 3 días a que me lo regresen)"
2023,1,Never buy
2023,1,I have already paid through card payment method but its coming COD. Please check and send us properly.
2023,1,The refund process is so slow. So disappointed
2023,5,Good
2023,3,Good
2023,1,Favourites no longer save
2023,1,Worst experience ever I never getting back my refund after returning that parcel the parcel is succesfully return to their warehouse but i never recieved my refund
2023,1,Can't even log in my account in your app. Have tried multiple times.
2023,1,Complicated
2023,1,App is not good take too much time to refund the returned item
2023,1,2 minutes silence for Indian people
2023,2,Very slow
2023,1,"always cant log in to my account, when it is logged in, cant show my member detail."
2023,3,"I like h&m but ,, they should provide proper size charts for their particular products."
2023,5,nice
2023,1,"There is no cancel order option in the app. My order got placed two times because of payment failure. When I went to the order section, i could not find the cancel option. Frustrated me a lot."
2023,3,Quality sweater degrading day by day
2023,1,I cannot login through the app. Tried reinstalling multiple times but it's still an issue. Can login in my pc with same details.
2023,2,"As a new member to sign on, the app stalled."
2023,1,"Worst customer care service.. even after waiting for 15-20 mins, no customer care executive picked up the call... I've made the payment through GPay and the delivery partner tells me it's a COD order.."
2023,5,Love it
2023,1,No customer support services are available post purchase. Returning an item is upto buyers headache. Very bad customer experience.
2023,5,Love h and m
2023,3,Ok
2023,1,Worst online shopping experience ever. First of all I ordered a product. It showed order has been placed but later it wasn't there in 'My orders'. Later I placed it again so it got ordered twice. Then delivery boy came with two same orders in one packet and told me to take it and return one of them. It's been 15 days since they confirmed my return but I haven't received the money. This is the worst app. Will not make the mistake of ordering again ever and will warn others as well.
2023,5,"Most worst app ever. I have returned a hoodie many days prior and it has been successfully returned, still I have not received refund. Even I have attached my bank account to the app. Even if there was any option of reporting zero stars then I would have rated it immediately."
2023,1,"H&M is a great brand, i love their materials, fit, finish the discounts are awesome. But, the app is ridiculously buggy, after paying for an order due to some ""technical glitch"" my order was changed to COD and was asked to pay again. Often items i receive are someone else's or something entirely different from what i ordered. Messing up orders so often leads to returns and their refunds take almost a month to reflect on your account. Terrible experience with the app overall. Not recommended."
2023,5,I'm having a premium experience..
2023,2,No refund this app is fraud 🤥🤥
2023,2,Over-all good but my experience with returning of items is the worst Even after 1 month I still haven't got my refund I tried several times to reach the customer service but they don't even receive my calls
2023,1,Not for Indians
2023,1,"let us pay with non credit card methods , having us pay for cod or gcash is way more convenient and available to most of us filos, so just make it possible to pay with these methods"
2023,5,"Hm you are the best in fashion, hands down"
2023,1,can't even login
2023,4,Good
2023,5,Vayo sancho
2023,1,"Shopping online has never been so hectic for me They deliver products without tag and ask customers why didn't I film during unboxing, they canceled my order 1hr after the payment was made and its been 10 days still no refund I ordered one jogger and payment was made online but the delivery guy asked me for cash when I refused he took it back and when I called customer care he said ""sir refund aajayega""i think they just don't want to deliver products only scam people. Never gonna order Again"
2023,1,Never got my order. No one picks up if you call customer service and chat agents also did not provide a solution. Very very bad experience.
2023,5,Good
2023,1,Very bad service and return & refund policy is also not good.
2023,5,Good job
2023,5,Better cloths ok
2023,1,"Ich bin sehr enttäuscht mit eure Zahl Optionen, ich kann nichts zahlen ob es mit meine Paypal ist oder von jemand anderes ob wohl die verknüpft sind die Bank mit Paypal, macht bitte eur app besser!"
2023,1,I am tired of trying to login but it just doesn't work. FIX IT
2023,3,Everything flows fine which is great and all but I seriously can not even log into my account. What is the point of having the app and getting things on here if I can not even sign in? A big downer for me.
2023,1,The app repeatedly indicates that my password is wrong when it is right. As I could log in via Google Chrome each time successfully to show my membership barcode at the counter. Then this app is essentially redundant isn't it?
2023,1,"Cannot log in at all, despite resetting password multiple times"
2023,1,I returned two products. But refund initiated only for one product. Trying to contact someone all ths while. Its been months.
2023,1,Very cheap app. they delivered missing product and they are not return these products
2023,5,Amazing experience
2023,5,Best' offers available only on hm
2023,1,"Reset my password numerous times already and still couldn't sign in. I then try to become a new member, after completing all the requirements and clicked 'Become a member' nothing happened, the page doesn't respond. So frustrating!"
2023,1,"Dear sir, Few days back I have returned a product. But account details are not getting updated for refund after return in the app. Kindly solve my refund issue ASAP!!. Details are sent in the mail to customer care."
2023,3,great app but the main thing is that im not able to sign in properly???? like i ordered one time by becoming a member bcs i wasn't able to sign in and i had to become a member. now what.
2023,5,Iam not able to log into my account from last two weeks. I request the developer to kindly look into it.
2023,1,Very poor delhivery service takes more than one week
2023,1,Very bad return and refund service please don't buy anything from this store.
2023,1,"For any reason, I can not get in on my account. The system doesn't allow me to log in. So sad"

2023,1,"worst experience ever, i ordered 2 sweatshirt in an offer and only got 1 and instead of sending me the other sweatshirt they asked me to return the product, it has been so many days they still have not redunded my money. The cutomer care dont pick up your call and give false information about refunds. please don't order from their official app. This seemed like a scam to me. 0 star"
2023,2,🤢
2023,2,"The app doesn't let me log-in, as soon as i ender the login id and password, the login button doesn't work it just shows the touch but doesn't process, unable to login, only did once at the time of signup and now i am unable to see my order because i have been automatically logged out and now i cannot loginnn, urghhhh"

2023,5,Amazing
2023,5,Phenomenal app & quality products
2023,4,it should be easier to find the gift card control thing and there are some bugs with paying. there wasnt enough on my gift card so i used a credit card to pay the rest and it removed the money from my giftcard and the whole amount from my card too.

2023,1,"Disgusting service from HM Service is dead they don't respond to tweets, they don't pick up the phone, they don't have chat."
2023,3,"Everything is fine, but please fix the view product button that is used to view similar products. And also add an option to choose the payment method everytime when ordering new item."
2023,5,Superb

2023,1,Pathetic service in chandigarh. I had asked for pickup since many days but nobody showed up.
2023,1,Not even in my native language and no option to change it...
2023,1,"This App and Products are just forgery.Ordered a set of dress for my kid but they delivered an adult shirt.When asking for refund i made complaints thrice and they simply passed the days by saying 1 week,5days and 3 days etc etc but the refund is not credited till date and it's been a month.This is just forgery and cheating don't fall on this scam it's better to remove this app from playstore"
2023,5,Good
2023,1,"Nothing seems to happen, the goods are in transit for days"
2023,5,Nice
2023,5,Sh j to
2023,1,This is the worst app ever first of all the services are more than worst I expected and yah when they refund a return they cut the delivery charges and all in short it is a loss bcoz they are cutting the money which we paid nd other apps doesn't go in that way and offcourse it was my first online shopping experience from h &m and I wouldn't prefer anyone to shop from here it takes a lot of days to get your refund and then uh get to know that they havent returned the full amount. Worst experience
2023,1,The Delivery agent Delhivery sucks..... They never contacted the items are always in warehouse and it returns back... Have your own delivery sector.. the Delhivery is looting you H&M
2023,1,"This is the worst online shopping app! Everytime I place an order, my bank account is debited, but there is no payment confirmation. After a while, I receive a message saying the order has been cancelled because the payment could not he confirmed. This happened to me thrice. And once this happens, it is very difficult to get the money back. Multiple follow ups, calls, escalations later, they say they are unable to process the reversal. This is such a disappointment from such a huge brand!!"
2023,1,Don't purchase guys fraud company I have order 2 jackets received only 1 . Or refund nahi karte.

2023,4,"Keine Werbungen, sehr einfach zu benutzen und schöne Kleidung doch leider bekommt man auf der App die Kleidung anders als im Geschäft. Z.b habe ich vor paar Tagen im Laden ein Code gescannt und dann sah die Hose ganz anders aus."
2023,5,Nice
2023,1,This app is worst. I am not able to place the return request. I dint get the expected item and want to return it.
2023,1,So bad service. I did nt received my refund it's two months now 👎
2023,1,One of the worst app I have ever used. Felt agitated after I couldn't enter my address in this app. Special characters not allowed even if you aren't entering any.
2023,5,Amazing collection are there I like most wide leg pants and all 😍 and bagyy cloths
2023,1,"I have placed an order during the sale and got charged for it, but it has dissappeared from my account. The items are sold out and I have to wait to get the money back. Bad app!"
2023,5,Good
2023,3,"I love the app a lot but i've been facing a serious problem for a long time. Whenever I ask the app to notify me through email,when a product will be back in stock,it doesn't do so correctly.I've noticed multiple times that an out of stock product gets back in stock and H&M doesn't send me a notifying email even though i had made sure to notify me. Also, H&M sometimes sends me email about a product coming back in stock and when i click on it ,it isn't in stock i.e if sends fake emails about prod"
2023,1,"The app doesn't work, I tried logging into the app and i keep being told that I've entered the wrong password, Ive now changed my password multiple times and I still keep being told it's the wrong password. I've been locked out of my account, and I can't even login In. I've tried deleting the app and then redownloading but still nothing!"
2023,5,I like hnm a lot bcz of its amazing styles and affordability.
2023,1,There is a serious issue with your login process. Once logged out neither me nor my wife are able to log in again. Also the forgot password process isn't working as the email to reset pwd never arrives. You have linked the memberships to this app as well please resolve this cumbersome situation. User from India.
2023,4,Not gud nowadays
2023,5,"Good fashion, it's attractive,good quality clothes"
2023,1,Bad deals and experience stuff. There are better American clothing brand with better deals.

2023,5,Good
2023,1,App is not opening
2023,2,Unable to become a member of the same...so many attempts made
2023,1,Pathetic delivery i had ordered a top first they delivered it late after 10 days and on top of that I got the wrong top delivered . Now again i ordered everyday i call them as my order is delayed everyday they promise me it will be delivered next day and it hasn't been delivered it has been more than 10 days its just pathetic. Suggest everyone to not use this app.
2023,5,Love to shop
2023,1,"This app was great until I randomly could not log in anymore, even after reinstalling and trying to change my password."
2023,1,They provide worst customer service I was unable to make return and had wrote several emails and had called customer service and they are just lying about they have confirmed my return pickup but even after 20 days no one is cing to pick my parcel up. Totally disappointed 😞.
2022,1,Ordered kids dress set but received adult shirt..it's been one month still waiting for refund... useless customer service
2022,5,A very good customer care service.Also good clothing under budget.
2022,2,Unable to become member on the app
2022,5,Best
2022,5,Not kidding or maybe I'm kidding
2022,5,Please allowed size exchange also instead of return.
2022,2,Your app dont show the return and even do t show when return is picked abd and when money will be refund its big mistake in your app othe shopping always shows return process and all

2022,5,Good apps
2022,4,Not ba
2022,1,They don't refund u they ignore calls
2022,1,I have an android and I can't sign into the app. From London I press the sign in tab and it doesn't do anything. I can't send clothes for donations because I can't get the qr code for membership points. Your staff say the app has issues. I can't understand why i can't sign in. It's so weird
2022,5,Ool
2022,3,"H&m refund system is to bad, i haven't received my refund money yet..it's been more than 3 weeks"
2022,2,H&M is a wonderful app
2022,2,The greater the products the pathetic is return and exchange policy...after product is delivered it takes ages to get updated in the order column...all customer service say is that there is a Glitch in the app ( please come up with some good excuse) although clothes are nicely packed..they are crumpled to a great extend
2022,1,Worst app. Idk are they living in 2000 or what? They don't even have exchange policy and the app is so slow and bad with orders. There refund policy will take several weeks. Order hnm from other websites instead of there site. This app is pathetic.
2022,5,Aesthetic 🛍
2022,1,Poor
2022,1,Never ever buy from the app. My returns hv not been credited to my account for 6 months now. Plus they hvnt returned the money for items that were missing in the delivery!! The most horrible experience DO NOT BUY!
2022,5,Good app for online shopping users.
2022,5,I love it
2022,1,"When I sign in through website, the email and password are truly correct. When I try to sign in - in app, it always wrong. No wonder the ratings are super low. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"

2022,5,One of the best shopping brand and app

2022,5,Wonderful ❣️
2022,1,my refund is stuck for a month and still no news. so disrespectful
2022,5,Osmm app
2022,1,Prepaid orders are the worst. it will show that the parcel is delivered and you won't even receive your parcel and they take more than a month to give us our refund
2022,5,So good
2022,1,Sale kutto refund kb Kroge
2022,5,Nice dresses
2022,1,Payments deducted but purchase not showing in the site. Tried to connect with customer service but no one is answering.
2022,1,"I had ordered from this app and jacket was faulty and so I returned it, it been more than 15 days still i didn't get a refund and more of it quality wise local Indian brands are far better than this company. The company is earning interest by holding our money. Rather go for different brand or order from Myntra. They are far better than this fraudster."
2022,5,Amazing Experiance !!!!
2022,5,Best app everr! Rewards & ALL ❤️
2022,1,Pone qué mi contraseña está mal así que la cambio y pongo la nueva y me vuelve a poner que está mal. Lo he hecho ya 5 veces!
2022,1,You people picked up my returned parcel but you aren't doing any procedure to refund my money This is how you people work.its really worse app and there work is not good I'm getting regret for using this app
2022,1,"Useless app.. first they don't know how to take orders and when they do they cancel it by themselves and upon asking no proper response by their agents. One of them just told me to reinstall my app or restart my phone because I wasn't able to get back the coupon code which they gave me but after placing an order which got cancelled by itself later,the coupon was gone. I talked to 3-4 of their agents and had to repeatedly tell my problem to each but no one solved it"
2022,4,It's an wonderful app for affordable shopping platform especially for young girls.
2022,1,It wouldn't allow me to sign into my h&m account and was super difficult to use.
2022,5,nice
2022,1,Sign in is not working
2022,1,Not support the location
2022,1,Limited options for checkout!! Only selected credit cards are available. No other payment methods that are convenient and relevant like COD or Gcash.
2022,5,Great
2022,5,It's a very good and amaizing app . The quality of clothes are also super nice 🙂 . In short I love this app so much 🤍
2022,5,Best app ever use
2022,5,Clean and minimalist shopping experience just as anyone would like. Thanks H&M
2022,2,"Please add a feature in which we can pay if we can't able to pay first time it's very annoying if for some reason u can't pay for product for first time their is no option given to pay for the product.it stuck in Payment pending state, also add a cancel feature if accidentally we ordered a product so we can cancel."
2022,1,Keeps crashing amd saying something went wrong on their end. I can't do anything with it.
2022,5,Best shoping platform
2022,5,Refund take more time than other apps
2022,1,There is no option for exchange and incase if you return there is no proper communication of refund and refund takes longer duration as compared to other companies which normally takes1- 2 days.
2022,1,orders get cancelled for no reason even though payment has been made and items are in stock. sometimes i dont even get the refund after returning clothes. never ordering from this app again.
2022,5,H&M is the only time I see clothes I like in the best sizes and prices around. Just can't beat it.
2022,5,Love this app bro
2022,1,Useless app can't sing in mf mc bc bl fxx chu marane stfu 🖕🏿🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🖕🏻🖕🏼🖕🏽🖕🏾🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡😡
2022,3,Too expensive
2022,1,Unable to login
2022,1,I've been on hold for 20 min by customer care couldn't get my refund it's been more than 3 three weeks
2022,5,"I like the idea. H&M is my favourite store. Although in my app ""Find in store"" option doesn't seem to work 🙃"
2022,1,Not expected from H&M. I returned a product and after one week they are telling me that they are unable to refund the money. I sent an email but got no response till yet. Neither able to contact their customer service over call. The worst experience I have ever met with.
2022,5,Love 🖤
2022,5,Superb products best service ok
2022,1,Need to be able to filter instore availability. It's kinda annoying finding the perfect dress to only find out it's not available in store.
2022,1,"The app is just trash, better shopping in the store itself"
2022,1,"It is impossible ro became a loyal client, you simply can't click the option."
2022,1,They do not deliver on time.
2022,3,Very slow
2022,1,Very bad shopping site/app disappointment is all what I got .... It's very difficult to use Extremely bad
2022,2,It's not so satisfying because the outfits that i save in my bag is getting disappeared fix it and because of that it's so disappointing 😔
2022,1,Bad experience
2022,1,Refund Policy is worst it's been 19 days and still no response
2022,1,"App has lot of bugs doesn't work properly. Order get cancelled after placing and sometime app stops work, there's always some kind of error while shopping from the app."
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Lov
2022,5,Good shopping app
2022,1,"By far the worst shopping app i have ever used, I ordered 2 hoodies on 26th Nov. and today is18th of Dec. but they has not arrived yet, I called customer care more than 3 times , they gave me different excuses regarding the order, then I told them to connect my call to your supervisor they just hold my call for more than 10 minutes after then they disconnected the call without any answer and it happened more than 3 time, terrible terrible experience! This is very disappointing."
2022,2,Isn't the purpose of the app supposed to be to provide the experience of shopping without physically being there? I was so excited to see the sale of H&M and it was missing. Why?
2022,5,Best and afforable
2022,5,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
2022,5,The best. Top comfort and quality in decent prices.
2022,5,Great clothes!
2022,1,Service delivery is ridiculous! Orders get cancelled automatically after payment due to app glitch and Customer service says no payment captured.... Even after sharing transaction details no response over this! Such unsatisfactory services are never expected from a brand like H&M!
2022,5,Loving this app!
2022,5,Comfy clothes ✨
2022,5,W app
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Good
2022,1,I have order the item but it gets automatically cancelled and does not get my refund since the 30th nov 2022 and they are not giving the money back in fact they doesn't even care of money to give it back and will not provide the money back. In fact don't use this app and help me to close this app from the playstore as it is the fraud one. And don't buy any products from the h&m app. And their coustomer care executive are not that capable to resolve the issue. Don't use this worst app.
2022,5,Nice
2022,1,Ich kann mich nicht einmal mehr einloggen. Es passiert einfach nichts. Wollt ihr das ich woanders einkaufe...?
2022,1,"DREADFUL! Cannot sign in with the App, I've changed my password and even tried to connect straight from my email address (via the New Member 10% discount code - you click 'sign in' and nothing happens, I've tried adding the code manually but it said it wasn't valid and yet there's another 5 days according to the email; I've emailed customer service twice in the last 2 weeks and no reply, so I guess they don't actually want to make any sales!"
2022,3,Είναι περιποιημένο και είναι εύκολα να βρεις αυτό που θες ΑΛΛΑ σχεδον ποτέ δεν υπάρχει ένα προϊόν στο κατάστημα ακόμα αν το γράφει ότι υπάρχει
2022,1,"Dont want you to order, lol full of error"
2022,1,"they give reject product, don't buy"
2022,5,Love this app no problem with it
2022,5,Bestest store Ever
2022,1,"I have not been able to log in to this app for weeks now. Very frustrating. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted the phone, nothing ever works."
2022,2,Overpriced products 💩
2022,5,Good
2022,4,Always server down
2022,1,I like this app
2022,4,"I'm new to the app, haven't used it too much, but overall impression is good. Seems to flow nice, is organized and runs smoothly. Reason for 4 stars is because I can't sign in to my account. Enter my email and password and hit the sign in button and nothing happens. I just created my password, so it's not wrong or anything, just the button doesn't work/do anything 🤷‍♀️"
2022,3,Used to work well not anymore. Making online payment is a nightmare. Now only supports cash on delivery it seems
2022,1,"Worst app ever, they will deliver your product after 15 days"
2022,1,On my first order from H&M order status did not updated even though my parcel is delivered. Because of that i wasn't able to return the parcel as it wasn't fitting me well. Even after waiting 3 days after delivery still order status is not updated... Very bad experience.
2022,1,Please refund my money
2022,5,Half of the time your products are out of stock. Why don't you keep them in stocks.If u can't change your attitude it's better to shut down the app.
2022,1,"Won't start right, just white screen. When it starts fine, I can't log in my account even though all the info is right"
2022,1,I had ordered a cropped hoodie worth 1500/- and what I received was a cashmere beanie which is very disappointing. Now I've to wait for 30 days for my refund since it was a prepaid order. Really frustrated with this customer service and would never want to purchase again for sure. H&m definetly should look into their CRM and ORM and take it more seriously.
2022,3,This app is really slow and i know its not my phone
2022,1,Worst app never return our refund it's already 2 times that ain't getting my refund back
2022,4,this app is damm and some are very affordable for me but it as been 2 weeks i didn't get my clothes. l just wish they would deliver my clothes soon 🔜👍
2022,5,Love the brand and the shopping experience
2022,1,"Useless, not delivering at my postal address!"
2022,1,"There is problem with sign in, pls correct it and send me feedback that you are corrected"
2022,1,"Horrible refund policy, items gets cancelled after the payment is made and the refund process takes forever. Hate it"
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Worst app. There is no proper customer service. You have to wait hours to just to connect to customer care. Customer care won't help you with anything. They will just tell the status, which we can already see in app. I placed 6000rs order while placing it showed within 4-9 days I will receive my order but in reality they won't shipped my order and sent fake mail and receipt saying my order is delivered. There is no option to cancel order. If I didn't receive my order I will complain in consumer"
2022,5,Good
2022,5,H&M products are very impressive but I think the app should have been improved.
2022,2,Sign in button isn't working for me in this app.
2022,1,Mera account baar baar singout ho raha hai
2022,5,Lovin it
2022,5,Loved the baby outfits
2022,2,"Have always loved this app, but it all of the sudden started acting all wonky. My personal page is just white and wont load, i cant add anything to my cart, which in turn i then cant purchase anything. Been like it for a week."
2022,2,"As a man, I have no interest in receiving notifications about women's nightwear, so I disabled notifications and they will remain disabled until the user can specify at least the gender for which notifications are sent."
2022,1,"Once u sign out by mistake u can't sign in it again,it shows wrong password even u right the right one!!And u lose all the points u saved earlier!!"
2022,1,i can't buy any clothes from this app
2022,5,Quality op 🔥
2022,1,What's going on H&M? I can't amend my orders and keep prompting me with error message. FIX IT!!!!

2022,1,"The worst application i have ever used for the shopping.firstly they take too much time for the delivery.and after words after giving a correct information regarding the address and all,there service provider does not respond.and they give excuses that you given some wrong address and all. I had given my correct address but the delivery guys are saying sir it will take 2 days from last 6 days they are doing the same Worst application"

2022,4,The best site to buy clothes on the appstore
2022,5,Good for clothes
2022,1,"I can login on website but can't login via app, can you pls just fix the bugs"
2022,1,This is a scam
2022,1,"cant access my account, can't add items to my basket, cant add items to my favorites ... it was warking fine before - something must have happened around 6-8 months ago please fix it!"
2022,1,"Aplikacija prosto ne radi, nije moguće prijaviti se. Moze se resetovati sifra ali cak i posle reseta nije moguće prijaviti se. Ja sam obrisala aplikaciju jer je puna bagova"
2022,1,21 days for return & refund
2022,1,Fk this... No options for rechanging passwords. And full of bugs. Even I'm putting original email and password. It shows wrong
2022,3,"Now that I've moved to a different Country, I would like the Option to Change my Language to English, as I don't fully understand the language of the Region I'm in. If I had this option I'd definitely give it 5*"
2022,1,Never buy from online app. Very disgusting service... Bought a 6 pack trunks set but received only 4. It's been over a month now still didn't receive any refund. Cheapest brand of all and third class service.
2022,1,"Lot of bugs, payment goes through successfully but order won't be placed and surprisingly customer support tells it's a frequent issue and they haven't made any efforts to fix it and they'll make you wait for 30 days to refund the money."
2022,3,"I really like in HM ,and i order a lot from them. But i cant login in my app anymore. I was in Italy, i changed the region of the app, I came back to Hungary. I changed back the region to Hungarian, but after I insert my mail and pw, I'm clicking on the sign in button, but nothing happens. Its really annoying. Onlinr, and on others phone app i can login, butnot on my own phone. :("
2022,1,"I also found app really buggy. It ceased to recognize my password, failed to send password reset, several times, and then transferred my UK account to USA and wouldn't allow me to change region back. Customer services couldn't help so I have uninstalled the app. Think I'll move to Monki. Oh, and now it won't let me post this review!"
2022,1,After recent update I am unable to sign in on the app. I have to go on the web browser to the site just to go to my account.
2022,5,Osm
2022,5,love u h and m
2022,1,"Application is not working ,just accept the payment without sending me what I bought !!"
2022,1,"Horrible, Order Is not delivered on time, irresponsive Customer support. better to go with other shopping apps and the best part is you cannot cancel the order after cancel period, even if they Can't deliver after 7-8 days, you have to wait for delivery and then refuse to take it and then Your Refund will be processed which may take a month, Even small Ecom Vendors have better service then this International Brand."
2022,4,Good 👍 try it
2022,1,"App not working, neither user friendly. Checkout is taking too long while, unable to select delivery options n proceed to buy. Kindly share link to buy items in cart. When black Friday sale, it didnt work at all."
2022,1,Worst app for buying clothes. Specially when you get a great deal on sale and they cancel or not responding for delevery of your order... They have world worst customer service...
2022,1,It's been 15 days and I am still waiting for my products to get shipped . Won't be buying anything again from h and m .
2022,5,Amazing
2022,1,What happened to this app? I can't log in. And I have to open with another email id to order now again I 'm log out. Now how will I track my order? Plz fix this issue as soon as possible.
2022,1,"Return Refund process too late,,,,Myntra, Flipkart and ajio,,,,too good."
2022,1,Won't let me log in
2022,2,Still a broken app
2022,5,Good
2022,1,The worst app ever keeps logging me out and when I try to logg back the sign in button does not works
2022,1,Poor service bullshitt
2022,1,I absolutely hate the app experience. They gave me different orders both the time i ordered!! Please look into the matter.
2022,5,Best fashion
2022,1,Shittiest experience every. I had place my order 5 days ago and it still hasn't been dispatched. Neither i can cancel my order Neither contact their customer service. Dont do prepaid orders.
2022,2,"App interface is good and easy to browse on and purchase. Return services need to be more flexible and convenient should allow store return even for online purchases, Now just ups it is such a hassle for work needing to set schedule for pick up unlike zara returns are so easy on that shop, even online order can return to any shop."
2022,1,Can't even log in. Kept prompting wrong email or password despite resetting the password time and again. Rubbish.
2022,1,"App no longer works. It doesn't allow me to access my account at all. States ""error"" when I try to add anything to basket. Deleted and using a Web browser instead."
2022,3,The products which we want never comes in stock nor the the sizes the we want all are out of stock and it will be out of stock forever please bring the products back to stock 🙏🏽
2022,3,"Return/delivery service has been changed, and you are required to install said app to ensure a return or..... Just be! Optional to return in- store but that's also not clear on the return in-store. (6-12-'19) Great app. Makkelijk online shopping. You have to be fast in your order considering items are sold out often. But trying your luck on the stores is nice as well."
2022,1,App now only downloads in Greek! I'm in Spain!
2022,1,This is so frustrating my items got cancelled randomly after placing an order did a card payment amount already deducted trying to connect with the customer care service through a call and chat but they just keep on saying the same thing over again and again. What am I supposed to do when my amount got deducted and they are not refunding?????no emails either.... Worst app ever
2022,1,"Bad behaviour of customer care, the return process is very difficult and tough tough to contact delivery partners. Their customers support is even too worse. Never seen such pathetic service."
2022,1,"Keep login failed, same as create new account, failed to proceed payment, keep saying tenical issues. Tired in keep trying."
2022,2,Sign in CTA does not work.
2022,1,Even after putting up the password and username. That sign in is not all working. Tried changing password as customer support asked. But still same issue. Need to work on your app. Horrible.
2022,1,"Becoming a member was easy, but it doesn't let me login, for some reason. Changed my password twice, but didn't work."
2022,1,You have the worst customer service!
2022,4,120hz support request
2022,2,Where is the size for women flats??? I've been waiting the whole year
2022,4,H&M is cool I really like going into the store rather than ordering online.
2022,3,"Probably one of the best shopping app but need some updates on Metal t-shirts like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth,Pantera etc these kinds of clothing is not available people are dying to buy them please update it"
2022,1,Worst can't login to app.

2022,5,Good app
2022,1,Won't let me login into my own account. lol
2022,1,Products are good but the app is absolute trash
2022,1,"Ever since the update before black friday the app has not been functional. I can't add items to favorites or add them to cart, it shows an error every time. Now I have to use the website which is so slow and laggy"
2022,5,Slimless experience
2022,1,Login doesn't work on app. All the offers are based on membership but you cannot use it cause you cannot login.
2022,1,So expensive
2022,2,Weird app
2022,1,Good
2022,1,"What is the aim of having an app if you can't order from it?! For more than half a year (at least when I last used it) there was a notification that for Android it doesn't work and you need to use a laptop to finalize the order an pay. This goes against the idea of having an app and I don't understand why since so long it hasn't been fixed, as I think you are losing lots of sales whith this bug."
2022,2,"Aplikacija baguje u trenutku upisivanja grada, sto onemogucuje porudzbinu. Non stop me odloguje i trazi ponovno upisivanje podataka. Umesto da olaksa kupovinu, samo je nepotrebno komplikuje."
2022,4,"At the time of purchase it was all good, but while returning a products you dont like is when it all goes down. When I ordered a return request, they accepted but the order isnt being picked up by the team after weeks and weeks. Why is this happening. Please solve the issue ASAP The worst brand ever!! An Update after 2 months : The product has been returned and I got my refund back..."
2022,1,The app is getting installed but the language is not in English and I am unable to change the language.
2022,4,Good product
2022,1,"Produkty rzekomo dostępne w magazynie, a nie można ich dodać do koszyka."

2022,5,Great product
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,Their return and refund solution is terrible and so is their customer support system!! So disappointed by now as they haven't refunded my money even after contacting and sharing the issue a few times on the support!!!
2022,1,Does not allow me to sign into members area. I've cleared cache and I've uninstall and re-installed and still does not work.
2022,4,Good
2022,1,Selecting region one must have choice to select their own default language beyond the regional language as default
2022,1,I always have problems to login my account. Fix it .
2022,3,Costly product
2022,2,"Опитвах се да намеря един сличер (с снимка), а приложението ми даваше панталони? (снимката беше на син сличер на снупи)"
2022,5,Hey I loved h&m products
2022,1,No matter what I try there is NO way to sign up to this app. I continually get Wrong email or password and they are correct... I screen shot my login details when I created them. Not even their shop assistant could sign us (both my wife and I) up and get the app work.
2022,1,"1. I logged out from the app . Tried to login with same credentials but couldn't logged in 2. I went to the forgot password screen added my email address and clicked on submit , a success message was being displayed that an email has been sent but I didn't received any email on my email address 3. I tried to click on become a member button after adding DOB and clicking on checkbox . But the submit button to become a member was not at all clickable."
2022,2,"I agree products are of good quality but it people there are fraud. I have ordered on black Friday sale , money is also deducted but next day order gets cancelled,they told me its a glitch from their side and to place the order again.I thought its okk its a glitch but now the price is increased by 600 rupees . What a game played by h&m. ""Well played boys"" LOL SERVICE 🐕‍🦺"
2022,1,I used to like and use it but I cant even log in anymore.
2022,5,So glad I don't have to go back into that store ever again... Those people are too much.
2022,5,I like it
2022,1,Worst app !!!order doesn't show up after amount getting debited

2022,5,Best quality tshirt are here
2022,3,"App is great and works smoothly low rating for below reasons- 1. There is no option to change only language or able to select text to translate as I don't know (Swedish) local language and if we change region for the language then it doesn't work for sweden. 2. No option to share a product, none"
2022,4,Nice

2022,1,I've been shopping alot to receive points and get discounts but recently my points have been deducted and gone to zero when i was so close on becoming a plus member. Please Reply why this happened
2022,1,"I can't sign in from the app. It's useless as I can't make purchases through the app or avail those in app discounts. On the other hand, website works fine."
2022,2,Darpa menneskeretigheder
2022,2,The app has so many bugs. Took 15 minutes to place an order because it was not taking address and I was constantly getting address could not be verified.
2022,1,"The update is horrible. ..not even able to change payment method , app is behaviour like gajani"
2022,5,It's very nice very good website to buy clothes i really love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2022,1,"The worst app. Haven't been able to log in, in months. Uninstalled and installed again, changed passwords etc nothing works."

2022,5,Best fashion ever
2022,1,"This app doesn't work!! Is impossible to log in, when you press ""acess"" it doesn't allow you to accept. It has been a really bad experience so I decided to uninstall and use the website in instead."
2022,5,Ok nive
2022,5,Best quality with reasonable price
2022,5,Best and affordable
2022,1,"Worst Customer Care ever, so as the app. Don't buy anything in online payment, i ordered a belt, but wrong product came. I asked for refund and called customer care, they were laughing at my name, i understand Hindi. What kind of customer services making fun of their customers name. YOU WON'T GET A REFUND."
2022,5,Good quality and worth the price
2022,1,Not working on the phone. And tried requesting customer care to help a million times. No help. Needs an update.
2022,2,Tooo expensive and return portal doesn't work
2022,5,Best app
2022,5,Best clothing ❤️
2022,2,Worst online shopping experienceso much glitch in the app😒😒
2022,5,Very nice
2022,5,A perfect place that helps you to be trendy. Classy and pocket friendly products at same place..A must try..
2022,3,I'm giving three stars because I didn't find good customer response. Though it's my fav app but customer service is not satisfactory. And order can be cancelled only within half an hour after placing it..
2022,5,Best
2022,1,"My packages came ripped both on the outside and inside, 2/3 of the sweaters I ordered were too big, specifically the wool one seemed very large for a medium size. The app and website glitched out and said my order was in the warehouse and still being processed even though earlier it had said the package was in my city. I ordered a 3 pack of underwear and I was missing 2 of my underwear in the pack. This whole experience has been very unpleasant. Not ordering from H&M again."
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Recommended any day for sweatshirts n hoodies.
2022,5,Best
2022,1,Rubish glitch keep on pop me out from shopping

2022,1,"whoever came up with the online return policy should be mad, impudent and out of touch with reality! you cannot put so many terms and conditions for customer. look at online return policies of Mango, Zara, Stradivarius, just to name a few."
2022,1,I am not even able to log in. Log in button on the app is completely unresponsive
2022,1,"1 star for the app if not zero. 4 stars for the customer service. Ordered a few things, paid in full but all items were still in the basket. No info in the account hub for the order. Customer service said that the order was not successfully completed and have returned the money. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it didn't work again. Better order directly from the website via pc or laptop instead of using this app."
2022,5,Great
2022,4,"The app is great, only one remark: there are no belts available on the app when chosing country Serbia. Please add belts into the app"
2022,5,H&M is my fav company iloveit 💗

2022,1,"Installed the App at the check out, in the store. But it wasn't displaying any barcode for 15 minutes so they couldnt give me any discount, nor points."

2022,1,"Had a terrible experience with H&M app, as Im unable to login for a long time. After discussing with H&M customer service, they told, its better to DELETE app and use Website if need to view my account & purchase from there!!! Shame on techies behind this H&M app!"
2022,1,The app used to work for me just fine but 1 day it logged me out of my account and now whenever I try and log in on the app it says incorrect password but when I use the same login on browser it let's me log in ?
2022,5,Easy to use nice
2022,5,Smooth shopping and returns experience
2022,1,"What a horrible app! Never order from this app. I completed my payment for an order, still I got a mail stating that the payment could not be confirmed and they cancelled my order. I received no refund in spite of repeated requests. My friend returned an order and she never received her refund. The app is not functioning at the moment and I am not sure what to do."
2022,1,"plain bad. back then you would have to log back in again but that really wasn't a hassle for me because after I logged in all the stuff I had on my wishlist remained. but now, you can't even log in, and the last time I managed to do it all the stuff I had on my wishlist were gone. please fix this. :/"
2022,5,Wow
2022,1,Worst app ever. Never signs in. Always asks to make new accounts. Horrible user interface. The app is just useless.
2022,4,"Pretty good app, only issue is the limit of things you can add to your wishlist"
2022,1,not processed my refund
2022,1,I have been scammed I never got my refund back after returning I'm so disappointed give me my money back
2022,2,Some UI features need to be fixed asap if you actually want people to use the app. It would be good if you could read the categories for instance (white on white is definitely not a good contrast for typography)
2022,1,I have to login everytime i open the app and i cannot sign into my account for some reason. It's not letting me sign in.
2022,5,WELL APP AND WELL CUSTOMER SERVICE WE HOPE IN FUTURE YOUR DRESS ARE NOT GOING TO STOCK OUT .
2022,1,Never works. Always logs out of account automatically
2022,1,Issue with placing the orders It's disgusting
2022,1,"Please contact me via email. I have the worst app and customer support experience. I recorded a call with one of your customer care agent, she abandoned me over the phone. I never hang the call because I know I won't received the survey."
2022,4,Nice
2022,5,Fabulous! ❤️
2022,1,cannot sign in
2022,2,Favoriten werden immer wieder gelöscht.
2022,1,Application is very pathetic i tried to order online but the payment didn't went through first time ! Next time tried again now money got deducted they confirmed my order later within an hour they cancelled my order i would never ask anyone to use this app! Even the in-store experience is bad their trail rooms are dirty !!!
2022,1,Order not pushing through but charging card
2022,5,"Wow truly authentic products, I'm definitely keeping it for the future☺️👍🏼"
2022,5,Good service very polite people!
2022,1,"Wort experience ever. I tried to make online payment, the Money got deducted from my bank account but order got cancelled due their TECHNICAL ISSUE. This incident happened on 31st oct and today is 10th November. Yet I have no clue about my refund. The customer service is as bad as their h&m app and it's technical team."
2022,5,Good quality
2022,4,Fantastic
2022,1,Useless. It wouldn't let me update my password
2022,1,Why can't I seem to download a version in English? Is anyone else having this issue?
2022,1,online prodavnica za Srbiju nema ponudu obuce..
2022,5,I like shopping on this aap.
2022,1,"App does not let you sign in, keeps saying wrong password and ends up locking the account! Even after resetting the password it will not sign in"
2022,1,"Can't sign in, says password is wrong when it is correct. Can login on the website but not the app using the same password."
2022,1,"I would condemn the devs to a hell of using this app eternally. How on earth did you develop such a janky app that even the most basic functionalities don't work? Do you ever use your own app? I can't add stuff to a wishlist, I can't remove things from my cart, I can't even login despite changing my password *via the app* just prior."
2022,5,Best app
2022,5,Excitement floods my heart everything I see H& M
2022,1,"Horrible. I'm not able to figure out for the life of me how to save a goddamn address. You'd think an international brand would spend on making their app user friendl. It acts funny. Won't save my number, address or DOB despite trying to change it atleast a 55 times. Can't order dammit!"
2022,1,Really the worst experience with this app. First time i ordered online and received the wrong product. For returning to warehouse package got misplaced and don't know when will i get my refund back.. still no update for my package
2022,5,Awesome HM best in fashion
2022,1,"It keeps crashing and won't save items to my ""favorites"" list. App was perfect until recently. ***EDITED*** STILL can't access ""favorites"" list without crashing"
2022,5,Love shopping in this app
2022,1,Won't let me log on to the app
2022,2,"H&M really needs to work out what's wrong with their payment portal. The app (and even the website) refuse to take payments online. I tried through several methods (upi, credit card, debit card) at different times throughout the day only for my payments to not go through and my order to be cancelled. I was forced to use cash on delivery which is a hassle to deal with. Otherwise the app is quite nice and I have no qualms with it."
2022,5,Love hm
2022,3,Sizes are not properly mention
2022,1,Terrible experience. Sale Is fake
2022,1,Very bad customer service. They refuse to take any action despite multiple requests. Don't make the mistake of purchasing items online from them. Either they will forget to refund you or they will forget they have picked up items from you. Lost money on returns. Pretty bad experience. Not shopping with h&m again
2022,5,Amazing products
2022,2,Please introduce exchange option. The whole process of returning an item while waiting for refund is frustrating and annoying.
2022,1,H&m app is not logging in especially in Androids.
2022,5,quality are good
2022,3,"This apps doesn't work properly, can not scan QR code every time I bring old clothes to recycle, can't collect points"
2022,3,"I tried to use the klarna pay later function to try it out and I cant select it at checkout. The only optoptions are the cards,PayPal, and gift cards. Would like to know how to use it because I really like the products on the store and would like to buy more from this store."
2022,5,Really good products and services
2022,3,"I am no longer able to sign in. My info is filled, but the actual sign in button won't register that I am clicking on it. Its been months now. Ugh."
2022,5,Gud
2022,1,"Awful app, you place an order, pay it, then you have to place it again on a laptop or desktop cause it's not confirmed. Why would you bother having the app? Thanks HM for keeping my money blocked."
2022,5,👍 good
2022,4,So far so good.
2022,5,Love shopping from here ❤️

2022,1,"Horrible app . I often get bugs, paying problems or is not working."
2022,5,Very Genuine products. 100% orginal and picture matched
2022,1,All my three orders sent via DHL doesn't have the street address on it as per DHL tracking. How did you manage to ship 3 orders without my street address?
2022,1,"Customer service is terrible. Orders placed randomly gets cancelled for no reason, even though payments are made. What's worst is that they deny any service or refuse to refund. Never trust H&M for ffs."
2022,5,Good
2022,1,A number of bugs that need to be fixed. Not a great shopping experience
2022,5,Easy to use
2022,1,"This app doesn't have good interface and constantly crashes, it crashed right as I was confirming the order and now I'm charged but it didn't process the order. Pain in the neck since day 1."
2022,1,App signed me out after I placed an order. I've been unable to sign back in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled still can't sign in
2022,3,"Haven't ordered anything from app before but the shop items are good, some items come up smaller than the required size"
2022,5,Best quality clothes for babies.
2022,1,No install it
2022,2,They took away the conscious search option makes it super hard for me to know what's organic and not. Frustrating.
2022,2,The size guide is terrible on this app.
2022,5,Awesome 😎
2022,5,I love this it helps me find thing easily it saves me time by going to the mall to get things just 10/10
2022,5,No issues with this app..my favourite site to shop i love h&m so so much and it's site is best
2022,5,Very convenient and amazing quality!
2022,1,"He realizado un pedido y días después aparece que está como entregado con éxito a mi domicilio. Sin embargo, no ha sido recibido a mi domicilio adscrito...😕 Opto por escribirles y me dicen que espere de 24/48h por si recibo el pedido. Dos días después, les actualizo acerca de que la situación sigue igual y posteriormente, deciden proceder a un reembolso cuando ni me dejaron rectificar acerca de la decisión... No sé qué me da más pena: el trato o la ropa que no me ha llegado..."
2022,5,Excellent
2022,4,Ok
2022,1,Cloths are realy nice but can't login to this app
2022,5,Awesome
2022,1,Points not being added to account after purchases are made. Filter keeps resetting when searching for clothing. Was a good app but annoying now.

2022,5,Reasonable prices
2022,1,i hate this app...they didn't care customer and its been 20 days or more ive never received my refund also i return my parcel because its not authentic and bad quality
2022,1,Due to to much of rate
2022,1,Refund period is too long and horrible too. I have purchased product of Rs.1299 After 15-20 days they said they have initiated my refund of Rs.1299 on phone call but I recieved the email written that refund has been initiated of Rs. 799 This app costomer service is also worse They are making money by fooling us . I don't feel this app is genuine Better buy h&m products from trusted app Myntra .
2022,3,Kindly manage the Exchange product ...
2022,5,Good quality products.wish it had exchange option
2022,5,Can't sign in 🙄 * Update : I can sign in!!! *
2022,1,Has problems with purchase so annoying definietly need to update this app
2022,1,"It is not possible to sign in because my password is longer than your app apparently allows to enter. However, it works fine on your website."
2022,1,What the hell is wrong with this app..I'm not able to sign in as it shows that I have putted wrong password on it..but when I checked it on my email..it was not the wrong password..I even tried to change the password and resign it..but still it doesn't work..ok but when I tried to get the membership than again it was loading and loading not that my network was slow... Other apps were working perfectly fine .. but this app sucks in this point.. please fixed this
2022,1,Very slow app never works with me and can't ever log in when I forgot the Passwort it's always in the mode wait wait wait
2022,1,Fake app
2022,1,I was waiting for Diwali sale and when sale started all the canvas shoes were out of stock though I waited for 2 days it always tells that this item is out of stock . My suggestion is if you don't wanna sell it for lower price then why you act like sale is on .
2022,1,I wanted to login but it's saying wrong password or email.... I am using this email since from 8 years lol h & m
2022,2,"I can't make an account, it's just stuck on loading. very frustrating"
2022,5,Go for it❣️
2022,1,I have been using H&M app for long time but recently everytime l purchase I face issues with payments either the payments go through but doesn't show in my h&m account or I can't purchase anything.
2022,5,Bring more style fashion

2022,3,I return a order but it's been a month now but I didn't receive my refund
2022,1,Your app doesn't work I am to sign in since 2 months from app. Everytime I shop I need to use website. App is of no use.
2022,2,Its reqlly easy to find certain products but i hate how it logs you out of your account and doesnt let you sign back in. It also annoys me when the cart suddenly empties out or i cant put certain items in my favourites
2022,5,Very nice❤️
2022,1,Worst experience ever. Eventually your order gets cancelled and it's very hard to get in touch with the customer care. By instance you will get connected over call with them they will put your call in hold and be gone for a very long time. Such a worst experience. I don't know why they are doing this. It will just degrade their reputation.
2022,1,"Bad customer services, my order returned coz I missed one call.. another one has been delay with not good reason. Ask for help in chatbot but not much of help."
2022,2,Unable to become a member and also items in cart automatically vanish. Poor app experience. Needs to be fixed
2022,1,"They take the product but then they deny & say that we haven't got product, so we can't refund the amount. Refund Policy is Pathetic, 30 working days for refund, Zara, Ajio and Myntra are better in everything"
2022,1,"I can't even log into this, it says my password is wrong again and again when I'm submitting the right one, wanted to order a pair of trainers but it doesn't even log in, please fix this problem"
2022,1,"would rate higher if i can sign in, I put in everything correct but it wont log in and when I try on pc it works normal?"
2022,1,"I have never seen staff of any reputed store more rude than H and M Ludhiana Punjab , yesterday we went to store at 3:05 pm just to exchange my son's sweatpants as it was the last day to do so and we wanted just 1 size up , the staff a lady didn't let us in as store was to close due to Divali , we requested as we had traveled 220 km to the store from Fazilka. But all requests fell on deaf ears .she didn't let us in even after we said we just need 10 mins which she could have allowed easily ."
2022,1,"So less stock, checked it a minute ago and stock out. Why do you keep less?"
2022,5,Best cloths
2022,5,Amazing😍
2022,1,"Apps are terrible. Can't log in, can delete items in cart."
2022,5,Excellent 👍
2022,5,Best one🥰
2022,1,Cannot log in anymore.
2022,1,Waste of money meine slider order Kiya tha aur online payment liya paise Gaye par slider aayi nahi abhi tak orders mein bhi check Kiya hai hi nahi 😑
2022,5,"More than expected,more types to choose"
2022,5,Good offer up right now
2022,3,The app freezes and lags when I try to become a member
2022,1,Seriously a bad experience ...like the even the customer service is worst...they don't even tell u if the order is cancelled from there side..... u'll have to call urself to customer care nd then they'll tell u if ur order Is cancelled due to some silly reason nd that to without even a notification... seriously never gonna use the app again
2022,1,"There is no option to change the language while keeping the current location. Seriously, application designers do not know that people are currently traveling, moving and that not all of them speak the language of the country they are currently in? The big disadvantage that there was no option to choose the English language in the Nethe location? Another disadvantage is that you have to create a new membership account for a different location, my Polish membership does not work in Netherlands"
2022,1,I bought mom jeans but I have noticed lint on it near inner thigh region.. the product quality was not good
2022,1,The regio and the language shouldn't be connected. System language is English. So change the app language to English. Lazy programming.
2022,3,Great cloths but app is filled with bugs n glitches plz improve it
2022,5,Outstanding
2022,2,I'm trying to sign up for their loyalty program so I can use klarna... it's so difficult for no reason and it's not very smart that you can only access it with your phone. I can't even sign into my account with the app. this is very disappointing and it's making me think if the clothes are even worth it at this point. it's not like their pieces are super original anyway.
2022,5,I love this app. There are te best clothes!I love it!
2022,5,👍👍
2022,1,I can't login anymore since the password keeps changing after I typed the correct one in.
2022,5,Nice
2022,1,"I am always getting the French version, I am english speaking g only."
2022,2,"Products are good but delivery process is too bad... When I am ordering something from the app, it is getting so delayed to reach and also many times the order gets cancelled automatically..."
2022,4,Please give exchange offer also
2022,3,I am not able to login to the app.
2022,5,I love this app!!
2022,5,Nyc
2022,1,"internet działa dobrze, w samej aplikacji inne rzeczy się ładują, ale zakładka moje konto już nie - a to w niej jest kod który trzeba zeskanować żeby dostać jakąkolwiek zniżkę w tym sklepie.... żenada"
2022,3,why are all chunky boots out of stock but get them in stock
2022,1,The return and refund policy is very bad you have to wait very long for refund dont use the app very bad user interface
2022,5,❤❤❤❤
2022,5,Best experience in style
2022,1,"Finally this is only place I can enquire, i have returned a product and i still haven't received the money back , whenever i open the customer care option on payments or return ,its not even opening a page ,idk where to enquire about this"
2022,3,"Zu viel Fehler für Kleidungen, die nicht mehr in Vorrat sind."
2022,1,This is worst the app is just stuck on H&M white screen and its not moving further Worst app
2022,5,Amazing
2022,5,The best shopping app i have ever seen
2022,2,"App not working, cannot add anything to basket or wishlist, and my account doesn't load"
2022,1,"Very very disappoint from cancelled order and customer support, I ordered items of 32186 and I need to cancel because I have another task on the date of delivery, but I didn't get refund within their refund policy when I connected to customer exicutive officer and tell him about my problem she takes 5 minutes to reply and she left me between the chat without resolve my problem just trying to put their system on me and told me to talk with bank and said We can't do anything in this matter."
2022,3,My wishlist keeps getting deleted by itself and i can't find the products i have saved before. Its really inconvenient if i want to buy something from my wishlist. Please fix it.
2022,1,This app sucks
2022,5,Fine
2022,5,Perfect💕
2022,5,App is nice

2022,5,I love h&m as reasonable price and quality
2022,1,Best cloths premium
2022,1,One of the worst delivery service i have ordered on 2 oct yet i don't get my product.. i request everyone not to buy anything from H&M better option is Zara or Levi's
2022,4,Good
2022,1,Extremely poor customer support service. They don't inform timely on the cancelled orders and I had a particularly difficult situation in replacing an order.
2022,4,I like the clothes and stuff but the app doesn't works smoothly
2022,1,login nahi ho raha
2022,2,"It doesn't have a response when connecting to klarna. And after activating, I couldn't pay by the app in the store."
2022,1,"The app won't let me sign in for months, I've tried re installing as well as updating the app, but to no avail, which in turn means I'm loosing out on points. I've called the customer care but no one has been able to help."
2022,5,HBK
2022,5,Products are too good
2022,1,Cannot create account:/
2022,1,"Usualmente compramos online en mexico, pero para las Tarjetas te obligan a que sean mexicanas, quise usar mi Tarjeta visa de USA y no te Dejan cambiar dirección de facturacion, si tuvieran la opción de usar cualquier VISA seria muy bueno, en todos lados nunca eh tenido problemas, acabo de saber esto cuando intentaba comprar mi carrito con $7,000 en ropa, ni hablar voy a Amazon a hacer mi compra, perdieron H&M esta vez nimodo punto malo para ellos"
2022,1,"Sehr schlechter App. Viele Sachen können gar nicht in Warenkorb hinzugefügt werden, obwohl der Bestand zeigt, dass die Größen da sind."
2022,1,The worst customer service. States that they aim to reply within 24hrs but it's been almost a mth and I've emailed 3 times! My email n pwd are correct but they tell me it's wrong but pwd reset DOES NOT WORK! Reset email nvr comes. Attempted several times over the mth. So all my pts are now inaccessible. UPS tells me order number and email are wrong so I'm unable to arrange for return pickup. Once again emailed customer service...... such a pity bcos the range of clothes are actually so nice.
2022,1,Can't login to my account.
2022,5,Very positive and uplifting
2022,1,Absolute horror. Ordered online and they sent me wrong clothing in my package. They won't refund me unless i return the stuff they accidentally sent me. I said I do not have access to a vehicle. They won't even schedule a pickup for their mistake!!! Now they won't give me my money!! Over 100 dollars!!!!!
2022,1,Lucky winners

2022,2,Was good for Ariana Grande till everything changed to kids sizes. Deleted an won't go back there
2022,1,The app says that certain clothes are not sold in the physical stores. This is false. I've seen clothes that supposedly were sold only online in physical stores.
2022,5,Open my app
2022,1,"Delivery takes forever. While tracking the item, it says 'Delivery delayed due to time constraint'. Hello H&M India? Poor"
2022,1,Very very poor and worst service please don't download it

2022,1,"My app is somehow set to a specific country (in my case, Norway), which makes it useless in another country. Tried unsuccessfully to scan my barcode in Poland."
2022,1,Worst app ever lots of glitches am not able to create an account also very disappointed and non responsive app
2022,1,Where did my money go? I had tried to order from the app my money got debited and the order was canceled. Now costumer service is saying that they did not receive the money in my hm account. Then who is responsible for this loss? That's not expected from a brand like H&M.
2022,1,Please Add Cash On delivery for better transaction.
2022,1,Great prodcuts. Rubbish packaging and delivery.
2022,1,Waste app
2022,1,The buttom for become a member doesnt work and no one is able to help not even IT costumer service
2022,1,"Crashing, hit the wall, right now I need a miracle, hurry up now I need a miracle 😢"
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Worst app there's no cancellation of product and coustom support is poor, i have placed order on 25.9.22 i have not received it till date never order here coustom support is also poor never care to resolve the issue."
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Fine
2022,1,"Absolutely rubbish. Went for a shopping last week as it was my birthday. I couldn't log in and I have lost my birthday and membership voucher. It kept saying ""wrong password or email"" which I know was correct. I tried to change password but couldn't do that either. I have paid a full price when I could save at least 10 euros. I am not going to even bother to go there next time. So dissapointing."
2022,1,The package which I cancelled till I didn't get my refund yet it's been a one& half month . If this will continue I will take legal actions
2022,1,"I cannot login into my account. Created another account, same problem."
2022,1,Can't pay via PayPal via the app have to delete the app then use the website because can't use the website whilst having the app on your phone.
2022,1,Bro fix your app. It's so bad seriously.
2022,1,Cannot log in....
2022,1,Made a purchase and the money was deducted from my account but no order was placed and the items were back in my cart after check out. Can't reach anyone through their numbers. Such a hassle. Reached them by email and they said the money will be returned after 3-5 business days.
2022,5,Good

2022,1,Unable to sign in
2022,1,"App is unusable, cannot get past selecting region. Uninstalled"
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,Nice
2022,3,"Love shopping at H&M, however to be a member here while in Japan, the only option for language is Japanese. Would be nice to have it translated to English, like most of the other countries. I am trying to learn Japanese but I am nowhere near the ability to read it yet."
2022,5,H&M over everything❤️
2022,1,"2 purchases in store (recorded in the app) but zero points so far. Apparently I didn't wait for the account confirmation email, which came 3 weeks after I first registered, so everything I spent before that didn't count for points. Lesson learnt, if it's not confirmed, don't bother scanning the ID when the counter person asks in store. Also, I shop in store and sometimes the internet drops, so please allow screenshots of the ID barcode."
2022,5,Best app and the best prices and the best clothes with which I can make an outfit exactly the way I like it!
2022,1,I'm having a problem in opening and acc in this app it's going on loading pls fix this problem
2022,5,Very nice app for online shopping love it !
2022,5,Awesome quality
2022,1,Login not working
2022,5,I really love to ware HnM 😊❣️
2022,1,Worst app cann't signed in and only member ship option easily click but other option did not work even i try many time .
2022,1,Worst experience ever I order shoes but it lil loose so i type to return but can't add my bank account for refund. I talk with customer service n i follow their instructions but it still can't. They cm to pick up my return but cnt add my Bank account for refund. Where will i get the refund Worst experience
2022,1,"Bunch of frauds, even after receiving their return they will not issue refund and blame it on their accounting team , and when tried to contact them on their customer care no. It will get disconnected multiple times! Never expected such pathetic service from H&M ."
2022,1,Worst app..doesn't function well..
2022,1,"Always delivers wrong product, of wrong size or a totally different product"
2022,3,Keeps crashing
2022,1,Now no longer there...? I've tried opening my app and I keep getting a message saying Fast fashion but now no longer here.. So what's happened and when will it come back?!
2022,1,Not working again
2022,1,"The app doesn't load. It shows the logo and then that's it. Been waiting for 10 minutes and nothing, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it still happens. Annoying because I'm an H&M member and need the app to show my barcode instore."
2022,1,What did you do? App now doesn't work....😭
2022,1,Too many issues with H&M unfortunately
2022,1,"App worked fine until most recent update, now it doesn't work at all."
2022,3,I had no problem ordering stuff and I actually loved the app but for some reason I can't even log into it any more. I hope it'll be fixed soon!
2022,1,Just get some weird message and app doesn't open despite uninstalling and reinstalling. Absolutely useless.
2022,1,"Worst experience. The customer service is although good, but the working system, is pathetic. I'd ordered one item, the size it was showing, was different what i received. And the second item i ordered, same . The size was different. The returning process is also very poor. I tried to add the bank account details to my h&m acount. But it's not showing anything. The whole page is showing blank. Nothing is coming clear. Go and shop in stores . Not online. My experience was definitely not good."
2022,5,Love love love H & M so many offers and benefits
2022,1,Items to expensive for middle class people
2022,1,So lembab.. The apps lag and loading so damn long
2022,1,Sucks! Can't login... Tried a million times clicking on the login button but nothing happens... 🤯😵🤬💩
2022,1,Meko ek order pe discount nhi mila aysa ku??
2022,2,TtRxwq what☺✋☺ke liye to be high school and sepbo
2022,5,Good app for H&M lover. Fast delivery and great offer. Love it 👍🏻👍🏻
2022,1,Worst experience through this app I have ordered a product and it was too small so returned them they got the still my money ain't came back and I can't even the payment page it just crashes when I open then how can I give my bank details...... It's pathetic
2022,1,There is no option to filter or sort search results. This is basic stuff! It's available on the mobile website.
2022,1,"Worst app, H&M guys you should close it and go sit at your home, you are dumb"
2022,5,"I like to use this app. It is easy to use. It doesn't contain any ads, it is very user friendly..."
2022,5,Very good product
2022,1,"Refund policy I am trying to add my bank account details to get a refund after returning the t-shirt, but the app keeps glitching me back to the homepage. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, it's really annoying."
2022,3,"It would be great if they offer exchange option like in most shopping sites to avoid the whole process of returning and re-ordering, especially of products on sale."
2022,1,I had the worst experience for getting my order delivered. I had no call from the delivery guy for what so ever reason. Plus the parcel wasn't delovered and then cancelled on their end without any telephonic conversation or communication. This kind of poor service is not expected from one of the best brands. Kindly tie up with better delivery partners.
2022,1,"Hoping that you can improve your checkout payment. My order did not went through, just white screen then returned to checkout page, but it was charged to my card. It took 2 days before the amount was reversed to my card. Then I tried ordering thru mobile browser, the checkout was successful. Their mobile app is the only problem, so for now, only thru their website works well."
2022,1,The app is not very useful. I tried to apply the welcome offer after creating my account for the first time and it was there and then I went back and added more stuff to my cart and then it just went away and was not available in the apple promo as well. I didn't even ordered anything. Then I tried calling customer service was useless as they disconnected the call without helping.
2022,1,"The app used to work fine, but for the last few months it has so many glitches I don't want to order here anymore. The things I put in the cart are not shown or sometimes I delete an item and it gets back in the cart. Sometimes my top banner with menu and search is not showing so I have to restart the app. Also I don't know why it is saying I have to download the latest app since I have the latest app installed. Overall I think you should fix it since it makes for a very bad user experience."
2022,5,Easy to use.
2022,1,"Horrible Experience! I ordered something from the app and they sent me an incorrect size,I then requested for an exchange but they denied it and scheduled a return for the product so that my amount could be refunded, I have returned the item a long time ago now,have registered several complaints as the refund has not been credited in my account yet and whenever I call them the customer service advisors are so rude, they right away ask you to wait and disconnect the call.The app must be banned."
2022,2,"Please fix your apps bugs/glitches such as voucher barcode not showing up even though apps already updated, reset password email didn't sent and take time to reach our email, and people still having trouble login even though we already change to a new password."
2022,1,SlLOWWWWWWW UPLOAD even MY WIFI TO FAST.
2022,1,"Cloth is good but their RETURN POLICY SUCKS all time , i just return 2 item but they needed <14 days 😨😨😨. Not known what they at that much time period , there are a lot of online shooping app which are far smallere than H&M but there RETURN POLICY is amazing and REFUND ussued in 24 hrs.Please if you are shooping from H&M then just remember their RETURN policy, Right now iam wqiting for my RS.7500 and its been <10 days .Not satisfied at all 👎👎👎.AJIO,NYKAA,MYNTRA they have the best product"

2022,3,Hey! I would love to know why am I unable to open Woman fashion from main menu? It wasn't a problem before...
2022,3,It doesn't let me use two coupons at a time even though it says I can
2022,1,"When I click to submit for registration it doesn't work, button shows but not clickable. It obvious why they do this. To avoid paying 10% discountr for newcomers. It is very disappointing"
2022,5,Best app
2022,1,Can't get into my acc even after several attempts.
2022,1,Don't buy online dresses from this app.
2022,3,"Payments option in my account is not working , whenever I click it the just crashes again and again, I had returned a item due to it's size and I wanted to update my payment option but it is not working after the latest update , I hope for fast action against it"
2022,1,They cancelled the order with no reason!! Why do they even plan to sell online.
2022,1,Worst return policy brand ever. Every costumer service number email is invalid. Still not yet received my return money yet and can't even reach out. Everything is invalid.
2022,3,I didn't my refund
2022,1,"Giving it one star coz everytime the product comes in different colour than that of actual colour, had to cancel return everytime. Just a complete waste of time and energy"
2022,5,Good
2022,1,This app sucks refund policy
2022,1,"the app has so many bugs, it keeps crashing"
2022,5,Amazing app.

2022,5,Good experience with products
2022,1,Never use h & m again until they change their delivery service.... Evri like hermes lose parcels
2022,1,"Worst shopping app that i have ever used. Money got deducted but no reflection of it in the app. Pathetic from such a ""huge"" company. Utter bullsh*t."
2022,1,"Each time I'm opening the app, they empty my cart. It's really annoying"
2022,5,Best clothing brand
2022,1,"Paid for express shipping. Still takes 9 days to arrive. To compensate me for paying $15 for nothing, they send a 15% coupon instead of refunding the express shipping charge. Just a joke. Not touching this app anymore."
2022,1,"This app literally sucks, i didn't get any confirmation when i bought the products from this app although my transaction was successful too, but didn't get any response neither from mail nor from app in 2 days, and now my order get cancelled and my money got stucked"
2022,1,They cant fix the bug..
2022,1,Nul. Impossible de se connecter.
2022,3,Why is there no option for Thailand in the region section?
2022,3,Everything is great but when i re installed the app and tried to sign up my account there was no response I just kep clicking the sign up button still no response
2022,3,Please let us pay with Google Pay!
2022,1,My order didn't arrive but the money was paid
2022,5,Best clothing app ever.. For trendy and quality clothing..
2022,5,Amazing app
2022,1,"it's been a couple of months now that critical issues are not fixed, like login & purchase"
2022,1,"Can't sign in, tried literally everything. The app is completely useless at this point"
2022,1,I ordered one large size t-shirt but they send me Xxl size and when i apllied for return they came and took the product but forgot to refund me. How pathetic the app and sevices are.
2022,1,Delivery status and return status is not showing
2022,5,Loved it
2022,1,"This is a rating meant for H&M. I ordered for the first time and guess what; I got the wrong product and what's even more annoying is in the return section, there is no mention of refund or anything. No nothing. It just somehow feels so hostile and feels like they don't want to refund the money."
2022,4,I think you should improve the become a member because whenever I become a member. on the other day I'm automatically logged out as a member and then if I trie it again to login as a member it always shows that invalid or already existing email I'd plz resolve this issue H&M But the app is absolutely amazing
2022,1,Packaging is not good for the shoes
2022,5,good
2022,5,Products quality is top notch... chefs kiss~
2022,4,Exchange option should be there & refund should be fast
2022,5,I love it but i want more discount 😜
2022,5,Nice
2022,1,"It always has problems with purchase. If you pay by card and see transaction it doesn't mean your purchase is completed. Almost every time for me it is either double payment or blocked ammount in bank account, but ""no order placed in the system"". There is no fraud and if you talk to your bank you will get your money back. Talking to bank and trying to figure out what happens that's exactly what you expect from hitting ""purchase"" button every time"
2022,3,Need lil changes
2022,1,Highly disappointed Missing item was never refunded Love the brand Completely dislike ordering from the app
2022,5,H&M one my favorite brand it make always believe the quality awesome Delivee on time
2022,1,Horrible experience. They didn't send all the items. And they haven't refunded me even after 1 month. Customer service response was pathetic.
2022,5,Love their collection ❤️
2022,4,"It won't open on android , saying that a bug was found, prompting for a clear cache , after that still doesn't open. Worked fine until today. Can somebody help?"
2022,5,You smell
2022,2,I am not able to join as H&M membership
2022,1,"Worst app that I've ever came across, order gets cancelled after the payment is done and even after 8 days i haven't got my refund back. One of the worst customer service"
2022,4,Good
2022,1,"Worst services,they have delivered the item but no return option for the same address since 20 days"
2022,3,What's wrong with your app i cant open my account i tried 1000 times
2022,1,I had returned my clothes in December till now I didn't get my refund back the worst customer service
2022,5,Best online shopping platform
2022,1,It been 5 months I waited for a product but the Size still isn't available
2022,5,Super
2022,3,The way you have to search for clothes is very unintuitive. If you delete one criteria it deletes all from the same category (so when i searched for white or beige pants and deleted white it also got rid of beige). Only works well if you want to mindlessly browse for clothing.
2022,5,💕
2022,5,Nice app
2022,5,Good
2022,4,"Cancelling order should be easier , with more clarity , rest else is top notch"
2022,1,Terrible experience with the newer version of the app. Cannot remove from the basket or add to wishlist any item
2022,5,Love the brand. Love the collections. App is quite user friendly too.
2022,5,This is my and my girlfriend's best brand for clothing. Really comfortable and versatile.
2022,1,"THEY DELIVERED WRONG ITEMS. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. IT IS SO MUCH HASSLE! DO NOT ORDER USING THIS APP, SO MANY USERS HAVE BAD REVIEWS AND THEY ARE ALL TRUE!"
2022,5,Best brand ever !
2022,1,Ths app doesn't work properly.
2022,1,Worst service from h&m very very worst refund of money will take more than a month plz.....do not purchase here u go in myntra or store the refund policy is not good....😒😒
2022,5,It is my favourite brand and it's aesthetic too and I personally love a lot to shop from here.🤍
2022,5,This app is literally very good 👍🏻
2022,1,I didn't get my refund
2022,1,"They have a third class customer service agents who are sleeping and not resolving the concern. My payment was charged but the order did not get confirmed they told me that I ll get my amount back and it's been more than 20 days they don't have a record i mean seriously, i have called them thrice but no assistance was given infact their employees are shouting and saying we cannot see any transaction. Now my bank will show you a charge with a chargeback and absolutely not recommend to anyone"
2022,5,Good
2022,4,"Overall App is great, but only problem with refunds. They are very slow when it comes to refunds. I'm still waiting for my refunds, it's already been one nd half month but still didn't get any update yet."
2022,1,I can't log into the app. I've unistalled it and reinstalled it. I've changed my password 3 times and nothing works. I've never had this problem before.
2022,1,App not working can't login my id coupons get expired before the date
2022,5,DC union Station crew!!!
2022,5,Love h&m and the app easy to use xx
2022,3,I am trying to sign up and it's not proceeding. Really disappointed by this.
2022,5,I just love it 😍 it make my day whenever I enter for shopping in h&m it just make me wonderful and awesome thinking about will the dress suits on me😁🔥
2022,5,Beautiful app and product quality is simply superb! Love it
2022,1,"The app doesn't work well on any phone at all. You have to go to the official website and then purchase. Plus they are not shipping products at places where they could ship products. Once you order through the H&M app, your amount from will be paid from the credit card without the order confirmation. Someone can take a huge step on such illegal practices taking place under the brand."
2022,1,Where is my order I made via this app? It says 3-4 days and always it takes forever. Its been 5 days and there is no action on shipping my order. Plus there is no chat option with the customer service. You leave your customer with no options. Such a shame for H&M Home !
2022,5,Comfortable and trendy
2022,1,"registration will flood you with spam, it feels impossible to properly undubscribe"
2022,5,Amazing reward
2022,1,Can't log in. The log in button shows no response

2022,5,Best brand
2022,1,It gets me out of the app THE WHOLE TIME I can't shop at peace without the app closing itself Edit: the app keep disappointing me.Today I opened it to scan my ID member barcode just to see that all my previous points are gone!!Please fix it
2022,1,It takes them more than 8-10 working days to deliver items to Bangalore at this point of time where we get nextday/ same day delivery. Pathetic 😂
2022,3,Should have outlet available stock.. called ur hotline to check some items but no answer..
2022,1,Doesn't let you sign in
2022,1,Where is my order? How my order is delivered without verification code?
2022,4,Good
2022,1,I am not happy with the app. I cannot login. Created 2 accounts and still cannot login into the app. Very bad app

2022,1,Losing all my points !!!! And already a member but keep stated there join member .... 😑😑 even today I bought 2 items as a walk in customer ....still cannot scan my membership.... it's just disappeared 😕 😔 😪 .... not happy at all!!!
2022,5,Quality and the cloth etc were awesome!! But please check the bugs while making the payment. Worst experience while making payment.
2022,5,Love h&m
2022,5,"My fav. Clothes, love it!💗"
2022,5,"I love h & m could live there if I could - all their clothes are amazing and my favourite. The app is very good had no problems with it so far, sometimes dosent always load when I'm in store, but other than that 5 starts outta 5...well done hennes and mauritz X"

2022,5,Good very good
2022,4,Good :)
2022,4,Good
2022,2,"The app is all good no bugs user friendly, customer service prompt but the main is issue is the return, they do not refund the amt until it reaches thier which takes around 5-6 days and then they start the process of refund which may take upto 30 days, well the quality of the products under 1k is pathetic, you can get that same quality for1/3 of the price you are paying here"
2022,5,I love this aap the most
2022,2,Good
2022,3,Not that user friendly
2022,5,It's good for me
2022,5,Excellent
2022,4,I LOVE THIS STOR & APP
2022,1,"Application doesn't scan qr code for recykling. According to the service it's the problem with the application, but then why it hasn't been yet reported to the developers? It's not my problem or problem of my phone."
2022,5,Nice app
2022,5,Best in fashion
2022,5,Lobeeeeee it
2022,5,Sojau
2022,5,Very good service loved it 🤗🤗
2022,1,Worst app ever 1.Always need to complain about the refund 2.Whenever any discount is used the item takes too long to get delivered almost 15-20days 3.Also there are too many size issues 4.Refund takes almost a month
2022,5,Lovely 🤪
2022,1,What's is wrong with h&m? I ordered a t shirt and sweet shirt and I pay through credit card. the money has been detected and still I haven't got any details related my order and even I got log out from my h&m account from which I have ordered is this how you treat your customer? You take money and don't even sell the products? I'm frustrated man I want my money back or i want my order as soon as possible it's been 1 week still no any mail or details about my order
2022,5,Like it
2022,1,Pathetic experience I returned one product and it's been a month still o haven't got any refund amount. Just FYI I also called on customer care number they said it will be refunded in 4 day now it's officially 34 days. When are you planning to refund my amount. Any help would be appreciated 🙏
2022,1,"The ""Divided"" gender section has to be the most hatefully titled thing I've seen in my entire life, jfc."
2022,1,Worst quality clothes
2022,1,"Totally a pathetic first time experience I have ordered 3 items two days ago, no email confirmation nothing, just in the app it says order received from last 2 days, the chat option is pathetic customer executive says same thing every time whenever my issue has to be resolved. Not going to order any items via H&M app, I'll prefer using Myntra over this."
2022,1,It's not letting me sign in
2022,5,I love H&M❤❤
2022,5,Good👍
2022,1,"App hat einige Darstellungsfehler, wenn man Suche anklickt, öffnen sich zwei weisse Felder, nirgends kann man etwas eintippen. Total verbuggt"
2022,1,"Useless, backdated service. Returned product has reached wearhouse but still no refund"
2022,5,nice
2022,1,Recently updated the app and all my points disappeared. Very disappointed and unimpressed.
2022,5,Best
2022,5,Just amazing...
2022,1,"Worst, they will stole your money."
2022,1,"Pathetic you have to follow up every day for your refund, even when the app shows the order is received by the store. Pathetic return policies."
2022,3,Wrost experience. I hav ordered sweatshirts but when I received the parcel one of the sweatshirts were missing when I made a complain They said that I will get refund after 3days and when I didn't received my money i called again and again repeated the same now it's been 2months still they are repeating the same words. I don't know whether I will get my money back. But if the item it's not available in stock they can cancel it how can they send us a package in which our items are incomplete
2022,1,Delivered used products even without tags. Very disappointed
2022,5,Amazing fabric and service
2022,1,the apps cant working and very bad never using it again
2022,5,Beautiful
2022,5,"Very nice ui, great delivery, everything great😍😍"

2022,5,good
2022,5,LP q@
2022,5,Kjempegrei å bruke! Veldig fornøyd.
2022,4,Good
2022,1,Tried to buy 3 items and my card was charged - No confirmation or anything in my email nor at my account at the app. literally charged my card for nothing.
2022,5,Good One
2022,1,I place the order yesterday nd amount deducted nd nw I check my order there is no order showing.. nd how we contact your customer service.. phone no. Is switched off.. how pathetic 🙄
2022,1,Pathetic app experience. Always a problem with payments. Amount gets debited while order is not placed and remains in the cart. No sections in the app for failed transactions. No error messages displayed when the order placing is failed. Cannot even find the customer care numbers clearly.
2022,1,Couldn't sign in to this app and seems doubtful procedure at checkout when go through guest purchase.
2022,5,Very good
2022,3,"I love the clothes from H & M, great quality and style. But this app sucks big time. It needs to be fixed. Also, customer service is very bad, they never reply to your concern."
2022,5,Perfect
2022,4,Nice
2022,5,😍
2022,5,Ommmmmmggggg
2022,1,"This app gets worse with each update. I've been logged out again, and after changing my password, when I put it in, and hit log in...NOTHING. Doesn't prompt me on wrong password or move to the next page. I just uninstalled the app. Won't waste time reinstalling it again"
2022,5,Worthy
2022,5,🥰
2022,1,"Terrible. The app was working perfectly fine a while back. Now it's not possible to add any products to my shopping cart, can't check my details (i.e.vouchers, discounts, etc), as the app simply does not show this info for some reason, just a blank page. Wanted to take advantage of 20% off for plus members, but could not do it neither in app, nor on site, as site had some issues as well. Bad IT, bad business."
2022,5,Good
2022,5,My experience with H&M is good...Love to order clothes from this app.❣️
2022,1,"Keep logging me out and doesn't work when logging back in, changed my password multiple times, doesn't happen with other apps, only with this trash app."
2022,5,Very awesome
2022,5,One of my trusted app . H&M never disappoint me . ♥️ 5/5
2022,5,I love it
2022,5,Customer services really good
2022,4,The app is friendly and easy to process. Would like to get updated every time new stock gets in online store.
2022,2,"This is the first time i ordered from h&m. 1. Quality of the product is good but it's way too loose on me. So i wanted to exchange it for a smaller size but h&m doesn't provide exchange service. You'll have to return the item, give all your account details, wait for refund and then you'll have to place another order all over again for a smaller size. 2. You cannot cancel your order after 60 minutes of placing the order. The time to cancel your order should be longer (at least 12 hrs)."
2022,4,"So far Good experience shopping...but some shirts colour fades after two or three wash! so, little bit dissatisfied.... overall great app , love shopping H&M...🤘😊"
2022,5,Superb app 👍👍👍
2022,5,Perfect prices 🙂
2022,1,"Worst experience ever, Iam not se to login since one week all the items in my cart are getting selected and then automatically the cart is getting empty."
2022,5,I love it
2022,1,I really disappointed about delivery without information they just cancel my order
2022,1,The worst worst worst experience I ever had with this app... their refund process is just disgusting... it's 7th day from the day they picked up the parcel still not refunded... never recommend this app.. ridiculous...
2022,5,Stole my heart💗
2022,2,Collection are good but it would be good if the products are at the affordable price.
2022,1,"One of the worst company/not a customer favour company. Taking much more that the cost of the product and accordingly customer service is zero/not careing of its products /its customer/profit oriented not customer oriented/an attitude like a street seller. I had purchased a dress for my baby from VR mall Old tirumangallam Chennai,there is a little strain in it when i went to replace it the manager over their refuse to accept it. I hv made great mistake choosing this product/wastage of money."
2022,5,굿
2022,5,❤️
2022,1,To much expensive 😪
2022,5,One of my favourite app🥰
2022,2,Nice
2022,5,✌👍👍
2022,1,"Was fine until yesterday, Not signing in tried deleting and reinstalling, cleared cache and cookies still nothing."
2022,5,"The app works well for me. I wish there would also be an option ""check store availability""."
2022,1,"I can't even login. Uninstalled and reinstalled. It's the same. It keeps showing a ""waiting"" screen after login. Totally unusable."
2022,1,Randomly cancelled after the order charged the money even for the cancelled product and never return or refund the money... Disappointed Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very bad 👎🤢🤮
2022,3,Average
2022,3,Quality are not so good
2022,5,I love H&M products
2022,5,Easy to use. Easy access to sale.
2022,4,❤👍
2022,4,H&M is my style of choice... However the helpline service can sometimes take hours to connect. That's why 4 stars... But I love it.
2022,5,Good 👍🏾
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Good
2022,1,The customer service of h&m is so pathetic... I ordered through the app couple of times(unpaid orders) they never reached me... so I ordered for a paid one ... they never reached me neither was a call attempted for delivery nor a message I received the emails that it's on its way but never reached me... I legit ordered for the same order worth 4k approx 4 times but never received it. I called customer service every single day for a week now... but I still DIDNT RECEIVE THE ORDER!!!!!
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Gud
2022,5,They have worked on their conscious fashion and they have a great user friendly app. I check in weekly to see what is new
2022,4,i havent received my refund after returning tha last two products
2022,5,extremely gud..... it makes shopping easier nd time saving❤
2022,1,"I received a garbage item at INR 1890 n it took more than 30 days to get a return n refund , No one picks a call in your customer support, worst experience. Called 10 times going through all the formalities but doesnt work so frustrating. Your deliver partner lies and says that delivery miss out due to customer was not at home wherein i was waiting for the package from morning n no one shows up or no one calls . You guys stop your business with bluedart fraud."
2022,1,Missing English language if using it in Sweden
2022,2,I don't like it very much
2022,3,Good👍
2022,5,great
2022,1,"Fraud app, seems like scam... delivering wrong product and not refunding the money."
2022,5,the product quality is too good but the prices are too much 😀
2022,5,Wow
2022,1,not good.. no exchange policy
2022,3,The worst customer service. First return takes a month then refund takes another month. Worst!
2022,2,"Having problems for a few months now with completing purchases. App is updated, it charges the money from my bank, but ultimately doesn't send the order through and returns my money in a couple of days. So I have to uninstall the app and order through h&m website. It's just a bit annoying"
2022,5,Nice 👍👍👍
2022,5,Fabulous
2022,1,Always asks for an update
2022,5,Best fashionable outfits. Just bring more varsity jackets
2022,5,My favourite app ever💜💜💜
2022,1,I placed my order but it never came.
2022,5,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2022,4,"I like shopping on this app. The return process is very impressive. However, the issues i have are with the customer service chat option, if you minimise the chat window, it is very difficult to find your way back to the same chat. As for the shopping experience overall, i enjoy it. I like the purchasing and return process. The wishlist is limited to 60 items, and sometimes it doesn't even let me save more than 58 or 59. I don't think 60 items is enough, other apps let you save a lot more."
2022,1,"I have been experiencing refund issues,i placed for a return a month back still there is no refund. It's the worst experience as the item had been picked up the very next day and it's been m month now,I even called customer service even after that there is no signs of return."
2022,5,Verry good
2022,5,Very nice 👍
2022,4,Nice
2022,1,"Absolutely terrible, app doesn't load inside the shop so what's the point"

2022,1,"Pathetic app, orders are shipped with wrong sizes and then no updates on return."
2022,5,The products are sooo good ... But the products are limited and never comes back in stock which is boring after all it's a nice e-shoping app for me 👍
2022,5,❤
2022,5,Great shopping app🙌

2022,1,"I can't describe the level of annoyance when the app keeps logging you out and you stand at the cash register, everybody behind you is annoyed too and then you also loose all your points at the end of the year."
2022,5,Love it
2022,1,I have ordered a pant from this app what I got a different one and it's been a 2 month for a return my money got wasted no one reply for the refund worst app shopping app .

2022,5,love it..⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2022,1,"Pathetic experience with hnm....they don't have replacement option and because of that I have to returned the item to order the right size, they said they will refund the money in 30 days but its been almost 2 months and they haven't refunded the money, although I have called the customer care multiple times, they just put you on long hold or just raise a new complaint ticket but not interested in resolving the issue."
2022,5,"Subtle, beautiful products and easy to access n purchase."
2022,5,I am satisfied with everything I bought .
2022,5,"No problem here ,looks great"
2022,1,"Worst refund policy ever faced from a reputed brand, the audacity to send wrong shipment and when returned back taking 30 days to process refund, received only a refund for one item and they totally forgot to process another product's refund even after 60+ days. When I have made the payment for both the products at a time why can't you do the same?"
2022,1,"Worst experience. Their home delivery system is so bad and pathetic. The clothes are not ironed and stained and are packed without proper care. I oredered 2 regular fit sweatshirts (XL) along with 3 tee shirts (XL) & my god, those 2 sweatshorts were stained and badly packed with 1 size of XL and other small size. How irresponsible they are at H&M,Lucknow. I have returned their sweatshorts hoping for exchange with better care and size this time. Otherwise I am taking this H&M to Consumer Court."
2022,5,good
2022,1,"I CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP, maybe its just my phone that's causinh the problems but it says ANDROID 7 AND UP, i have android 9 so...."
2022,1,I wish i could give minus star. I ordered something few months ago & due to size issues i returned it... but the money wasn't refunded within some few weeks. so i thought maybe I'll wait for 30 days since the refund policy stated that the refund will process within 30 days... but its been more than 2 months now & i got scammed by h&m.. they say they refunded the amount when i clearly never received even a single penny from them. & the worst part is. most of the time they dont even pick ur calls.
2022,5,One of the best products
2022,3,Good bt expensive I prefer meesho more :)
2022,1,"One of the worst shopping app, no proper response from the customer support team they have no clue about payments and refunds."
2022,1,Too expensive
2022,1,Order won't get placed! It just gets loading and loading until eternity.
2022,1,Lousy app
2022,1,Partiality in providing services.
2022,1,Return Feature is Broke I tried returning my purchase due to fitment issue and it kept taking me another page externally creating ticket but nothing can be traced no one came to pick either
2022,3,Everything is good about this apps the quality the price but one problem is with return process...if we want to get refund it will take way too long..I mean 1 month is too long.i wish they could reduce the days for refunding.
2022,5,Amaaazinnngggg
2022,1,"Worst app ever . I placed orders two times through the site, both time amount got deducted from my account. And both time they cancelled the order. Most horrible retail website experience"
2022,1,App is buggy. Can't log in. Please fix.
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,Pictures of items don't show
2022,5,Good
2022,5,❤️‍🩹
2022,1,1 Star because lower than 1 is not possible! This app does not allow consumers to put bad reviews of products as they choose weather your review will be featured or not and a bad review is never featured. Everything in the app is 4 Stars or above even when it's not worth 1 Star which is the least rating a product can have.
2022,1,Can't login to my account
2022,1,This is the worst app for shopping. Their refund policy was just disgusting . No one responds and no one listens and understands your questions and they too too long for refunds .Their policies was worst thing in shopping domain.Stop shopping here .
2022,2,Good Sometime bad I don't know how to say To this app
2022,1,Cannot use app in Belgium. Uninstalling. Guess I have to shop elsewhere.
2022,5,Best shopping
2022,1,Can't login
2022,1,"I used to love this app and use it frequently. However, I cannot log into it anymore. I have tried absolutely everything. There is no update, though I suspect this has been an issue since the last update. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing. I put in my email address and password and when I tap ""Sign in"", absolutely nothing happens. I have to log in on the website in order to be able to scan my account when shopping in-store. Useless. I have a Samsung Galaxy S21+."
2022,1,I had ordered 3 tops and what I received was only one top along with one pair slides replacing the other two tops so i returned it right away. The thing is the tops were on sale and by the time i received the items it was already out of stock so i can't even reorder them. It's already near a month the order reached ware house and here i'm waiting for the refund yet... Please improve your return and refund policy
2022,5,Thanks H&M
2022,5,Love the clothes!
2022,5,It's good
2022,3,"Half of the items are unavailable, either size or the item itself."
2022,1,Why is this app not in English? It's just a matter of translationcof the strings. Not everyone knows the local languages immediately.
2022,1,"I got a wrong product on the first order discount offer . I returned it and it reached h&m warehouse on 26th june . I didn't received refund for 31 days. After that I kept on calling the customer service for 7 times. I kept to complaining them and they kept on giving me the same script that "" we are sorry and it will be resolved within 2 days "" and after 7 calls on 15th august I got my refund. Never gonna buy online again. Terrible service."
2022,3,"Shopping experience is hassle free,but my concern is regarding the points .I am not getting points credited after shopping and also i don't get any membership discount in any of the purchase."
2022,1,"Worst service!Had a terrible shopping experience with H&M online. Placed a return ,the product got picked up but didn't not receive any refund even after a month! still waiting for my refund and the worst part..they don't even listen to their customers' grievances..! It's a Scam!"
2022,1,"In one word --- its waste of time. 1.I have returned a product it reached warehouse and been more than 30 days still waiting for refund. 2. Ordered 6 items , received 5 items and 1 of the recieved product color is wrongly delivered. For both of my queries I have contacted and their agents used to say same useless words. Just wait for 48 hours we raised a urgent request , handed over all your details to accounts team . Its waste of time and money here"
2022,4,Good...
2022,5,Always provides quality products.
2022,1,This app is a scam
2022,1,They don't give refund .they are fraud
2022,5,Nice 👍☺️
2022,5,💞
2022,5,This app gave me Best vibes while shopping 🤝🏻❤️
2022,1,This app not work
2022,1,It has been at least 25 days since I returned my parcel but my money is not refunded yet....???????? ???? Kab denge ???
2022,3,I am not able to log into my h&m account on the app but i can log in through the Google website
2022,1,The return and refund process is the wrost bad customer service
2022,1,I don't have india in region
2022,1,Can't login
2022,5,Best shopping app ever. Amazing quality and Fast delivery.
2022,1,"Worst and not at all user friendly application, every time showing error."
2022,1,Pathetic return service... such a pain
2022,1,Im trying to login from my I'd but unable to login my membership. When i clicked on to forgot password there is no mail coming in my mail id for password reset too. Kindly look into it .
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,Worst experience ever. Hang up and no inventory. Plus membership login expires everytime
2022,1,"Horrible experience!! This app is not at all user friendly and it's very badly designed. Learn something from Myntra. I received wrong item, hence, opted for return but it's no where reflecting in the app. How am I going to track the return item? Also when I add some items in the cart it gets automatically removed after few days. It's very frustrating to use H&M app. Definitely going to uninstall it after I receive refund of the order that I returned."
2022,2,"The app itself is easy to use but i have HUGE login issues. I cant login in my account. Just like that, the app ignores the login data even tho they are the right ones(ik that cuz i have not been getting any errors). The login button simply ignores me. Yeah, thats all, please fix this."
2022,1,"Everytime i close the app I get logged out then when i try to 'sign in' with the correct information for my account it gets glitched and just won't get signed in , i had placed an order but now i have no idea how do i sign in and track it awful app"
2022,1,I want to return the order because of size issue and the apps is isn't responsing that. Return policy is soo week
2022,1,I have returned my order 2 months back and I haven't got the refund yet Very bad experience And the order also gets randomly canceled
2022,5,I love H&M. I just love it so much. Please marry me H&M 🥺
2022,5,Very easy to use
2022,5,Good
2022,1,H and m keeps us on our toes everytime when we are ordering something on sale. And now members are even unable to sign in in their application. And what's worse is without signing in you cannot avail discount and even place order. And if some how you are late...the item gets out of stock Please rectify this problem. Update this app.
2022,5,Poop
2022,5,Great 😃👍 such a fast delivery app
2022,1,For some reason I can not change the app to be in English.
2022,3,Too much bug like it's not showing my order on order section
2022,1,"Kaze da prije narudzbe instaliram novu verziju, nove verzije nema za instalirati. Bris stvari iz wishliste samo od sebe"
2022,5,Nice:)
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,They r cheaters specially da Indian site they r spoiling da brand name I returned an item n they did not refund me bloody chor...
2022,3,There should be a tracking system to check on returns and refunds on the app... First chatting wit a bot then a customer care executive is very inconvenient.
2022,1,"I've created an account but every time I want to log in, it shows me that the password or email is incorrect. I tried to reset my password but it keeps popping up the same."
2022,1,"I didn't recieve a refund for a product i returned weeks ago , it stills shows delivered . The customer service is not at all helpful. Called there like hundred times but the call never gets connected. Soo frustrating 🙂"
2022,1,"Very bad customer service, rudely conversation, they don't have any manners"
2022,4,Add dark mode.
2022,5,Good app but not installed
2022,1,Can't add products to my wishlist anymore and products keep on disappearing my wishlist. Worst app!
2022,1,"Was easy to use but no longer works on my phone after latest update - closes app instantly. Have tried reinstalling, no luck"
2022,1,Worst place to order the clothes.. The returns take so much time. The customer care never gets picked. The mails are never reverted. Its been 15 days i haven't got my money refunded. Really very dissatisfied. Never repeating my mistake.
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Gud brand
2022,1,You will never get your refund. My refund is pending since April. Pathetic customer service.
2022,5,I like the app
2022,1,The app does not process orders but credits the transaction. Customer service took 3 days to call and inform me that they have to refund which takes another 3-5days. They told me to reorder using a laptop/desktop. No thanks. Useless.
2022,4,Sometimes error occurs while placing order
2022,5,Good site
2022,5,Superb quality 👌 👏 👍
2022,5,Just wow...
2022,5,Amazing and economically feasible clothing!
2022,1,I am unable to login in my account since one month. I even tried resetting the password but nothing happened.
2022,5,Wonderful app
2022,1,"The products are good at reasonable price but the service is very very poor in India here because they won't let you use your coupon until it is all wasted they will just cancel your order , the same product has been cancelled till my coupon was totally wasted not once but thrice they have cancelled the same order , vvvvvv poor"
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Worst in terms of giving refund
2022,5,Good product
2022,1,"There's a bug in sign in page , even though how many times I enter my mail and password , it's asking me again and again. With my existing account details also it's unable to sign in"
2022,1,Veryy poor i ordered the items and the items were damage some kind of stain was there . So i returned the order and the order was picked the very next day but no refund and the app too is also not showing refund worst experience please don't download this app waste of time waste of money kindly report this app .
2022,1,Very pathetic service. I returned the order on 9 th July. But still not received the refund. Tried to call on toll free number but that number was switched off. After that tried to complaint via chat option but that's also not useful. There no such real agent who can help out. Geeting same reply via AI bots. It looks like fruad.
2022,5,I love h&m
2022,5,The best❤️
2022,5,Good quality clothes....👕
2022,1,"Very bad customer service. They didn't attend to our query at all, just type my order number and and asked for my order delivery details... But they exit the chat box. Called the customer care but the customer care never answered the call."
2022,1,"for last 1 month whenever I'm opening MY ACCOUNT it's not showing anything, just a white page . I uninstalled and installed the app few times but the problem is still there . I cannot even add anything to favorites or to cart , then how am I supposed to buy anything ? Please fix this issue ."
2022,5,Perfect Brand with affordable prices of clothing
2022,1,I ordered hoodie received shorts now what a customer will do who is waiting for product they are not even responding probably very disappointed from this behavior
2022,5,Very very helpful app all dress and outfits are trendy and looking so stylish thank you h & m
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,Very nice
2022,1,Pathetic it is not working now I can not sign in. I have unistalled and reinstalled several times its not working.
2022,1,"The apps security system is poor. Once I make my payment, the next day I received more than 20x financial alert regarding more than 20 over transactions in oversea I.e. Canada. Seriously, this is scary when my payment data is floating everywhere n been used till I need to deactivate my card. Scary experience on the payment part. Other than tat, the parcel received for the goods is all superb."
2022,1,"Not really good customer service.. I have been waiting since last 1 hour just to speak to customer care executive about my issue with return.... Also, no option to chat about issue with customer care... Useless app"
2022,5,good
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Their app bugged out money got deducted and no refund from over a month. It's been so frustrating to deal with this that I don't ever wanna purchase anything from them. They have even mentioned it in their app that there is the issue of online payments on their Android app. Why is it hidden away in customer support? Normal user like me made the transaction. The order was never placed. Amount was deducted and now from over a month they are just fooling around with me, contacted em a dozen times."
2022,1,"unacceptable delays, which translates into a huge lack of respect for customers"
2022,1,Full of glitch not showing my my account
2022,5,Love the choices & value on cute clothes
2022,5,Love to shop from H&M❤
2022,1,"This brand is worser thn many others brand .... It tooks 3 month and still not refunding my money, 2068 money .... Don't use this brand don't download itt anyone... Refund process they take money from you but they will not return... It's a fraud app"
2022,4,Listen here h&m im trying to log into my account and it wont let me so u gotta fix this until i delete this app😒
2022,2,"This aap is such a fraud, i made a payment via card, the money got diducted, but the order was never placed. And on top of that the money was never refunded to me since 2020."
2022,1,"App isn't allowing me to sign in to my account. Also, i ordered a pair of jeans but received some other clothes instead. They asked me to return it but it doesn't show return option at all. Very dissatisfied"
2022,4,Good shopping app
2022,2,My account section is not loading and not sure what the reason is
2022,1,"I can't seem to do a return on the app, when I push the button it says page not found"
2022,1,"I haven't received my refund money back from this store. It's been three months now , i had even sent mails regarding this but still no response. Aren't you'll aware of the fact of returning someone else's refunded money back. How irresponsible behaviour"
2022,5,I love h&m it's amazing app
2022,1,Refund amount verry let west time and money
2022,5,Good Stuff Good Fit
2022,5,S9oooooo9 Nice
2022,1,Everything is fine... But you should not take any risk by ordering from h&m because they don't give your money back if you place a return and expected your refund on time then it will not gonna happen. It's so disheartening to say that this worldwide clothing brand is not giving my refund... I don't know what will they get in 1350 rupees?
2022,5,"O aplicatie utila, usor de utilizat."
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Fraud . They first confirmed my order and then cancelled it after half an hour . Is it a joke I've done the payment . And I want my money back right now
2022,1,"My order is returned without informing me. Firstly was a delay then my tracking ID info. Show's the order is returned even on the web page 😒😔😔😔😔 02 Aug 2022, Evening"
2022,5,Damdrai
2022,1,"Wishlist always empties itself and have to go out of the app to manage orders, returns, etc"
2022,3,"It's ok but sometimes it doesn't work, had to reinstall it a few times. It's still easier than to use the website tho'."
2022,2,Can't open app from notification. The number of favourite items are limited. 👎
2022,5,Good app
2022,4,Good products 👍🏻
2022,5,best shopping app
2022,1,"Order cancelled by H&M on the pretext that the item is out of stock, item comes back in stock a day or so later and my 25% coupon is not returned after hours (55 minutes+ each time) of conversation with phone support (who assure you the very same coupon will be returned, only to offer me a lesser, 15% coupon after holding the line for 55 minutes!) Tl;dr: H&M cancels your order if you apply a coupon. Unhelpful phone support wastes your time."
2022,4,Limited stock.
2022,1,Refunds are too slow
2022,5,Love h&m
2022,5,Only download it so hopefully it will mach or be better that the other shopping apps
2022,1,My parcel was supposed to be here Saturday its now Sunday night and I still haven't received my items despite me paying £5 for next day delivery I ended up wasting a entire day waiting in for my parcel and I was Disspointed that I didn't even receive a message from h&m or evri to say my parcel was running behind schedule I paid next day delivery for a reason because I'm in desperate need of my items I want a refund on my postage....why offer next day if u can deliver next day £5 wasted
2022,1,"What rubbish app. Doesn't get login. Not able to get any update on regarding the order placed. Payment got debited, no order confirmation, no app login... Just waiting for the order to get delivered."
2022,2,Couldnt log in
2022,1,"I tried to appley for membership through this app, but noooo.., it didn't came thru. fix it"
2022,1,"Cant take things out of cart, cant log in."
2022,5,Best fashion brand undoubtedly
2022,1,Cannot do a return on the app. Constantly comes with 404 error. I updated the app and still the same error comes up. I hope the company is aware of this as people might be missing their return deadlines when they're unable to do the return.
2022,5,Awesome and affordable
2022,4,Love it
2022,5,Good product
2022,2,unable to download it from Play Store tried numerous times. Irritating
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Great app User Interface and Experience. Shopping and checking out new collections on H&M is equivalent to offline store experience if not more. Would recommend this to every shopaholic out there ( all gender inclusive)!
2022,5,V good
2022,2,I have spent some 1 hour on this app in 4 5 attempts to purchase but never been able to place order ! The login doesn't work and a lot of bugs ! frustrated.
2022,1,"How can a company worth so much make such terrible applications. Every time it is the same terrible experience, with new problems every time. Now card was charged but the sale does not appear in my account."
2022,5,Great App!
2022,5,It's always great to shop here.
2022,5,Good
2022,2,Won't let me sign in. keeps saying wrong email or password
2022,5,Best products and amazing quality genuine price!!!!
2022,1,"Wish i could give zero their app and online service. Worst app no doubt about the product and quality but their customers service is pathetic. It's been more than 16 days i didn't get my refund of Rs 6000, have already complained multiple times everytime they would give new deadline. I taught maybe coz they take much more time to deliver than other app so order in bulk. Finally had to resolve to this method let's see if they resolve after the issue after being humiliated in review."
2022,5,Wow app
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Bestest app to shopping i know that the prices are not affordable but still quality is amazing like im really impress with this app literally guys you all must shopping from here😊
2022,5,Love it dude 😘💝💓👀
2022,5,Love it
2022,1,Horrible!! I am posting this review after failing on my third time shopping with HM app while checking out at the mall in Nexus Shantiniketan Bangalore It will not allow me to login. If I choose forgot password it allows to reset but even then continues to accept the new password This happened twice before also Why is it that the birthday month discount is applicable a week before instead of the entire month There is no point of a membership It is a waste of time and pathetic experience
2022,1,Rubbish. Keep showing wrong email/password even though just changed. Annoyed!
2022,5,Excellent brand
2022,5,Good products
2022,2,Price and material/fabric is not matching.
2022,1,I don't wanted to rate this app but without ratring i can't comment. My order got cancer automatically after 5 days and why is that fit it developers
2022,1,"This app does a payment scam i had ordered for product through card payment and my money was debited but the order was not placed and i,ve been trying to contact the customer service from many days and there's no response from them at alll . Very disappointed, Please do not do online payment through this app"
2022,5,So far Excellent customer environment!
2022,4,"It's a good app doesn't glitch and you can order many things but if you order something, the items take a week to come so it's a little slow"
2022,1,It won't let me put my card number in or my actual birthday
2022,1,worst online services
2022,1,Worst experience registered a return the item has been picked up for so long bt there is no refund and no update
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Did card payment n money was deducted from account without order confirmation worst part is that its not even shown in the order page.... its been a month now contacted the customer service but they are taking too long to process my refund
2022,5,Lovely collection
2022,5,Huhuhh
2022,1,🙂
2022,1,Our favourite products size are not available and some are out of stock....New stocks are not updated😐
2022,4,Overall good but need to stock up on more men's trousers.
2022,1,When I am trying to login to app it's just showing wrong email id and password even after trying so many times it's just showing wrong .I have checked it many times. That is pure nonsense
2022,5,Best app ever love all the clothes ... fabric is so good
2022,1,"Cannot make any purchases for the past 4 months. if i want to order something, i get charged, but it doesnt make any orders. So i need to wait for a week or more to get back my money. 😤😤😤 *deleting this app*"
2022,1,Worst app I've ever used. Delivery services are slow. Can't expect the refund amount. Customer service executives make false promises.
2022,1,"Pathetic delivery , takes 7 days no matter what mode of delivery you choose and what's the point in shopping online if i get it after 7 days , instead I might just go and get it nearby"
2022,5,My experience with h&m is always satisfactory. They never gave a single chance of complaining. Amazing app and best app.
2022,2,This app is good but I didn't get my refund back
2022,5,great ui
2022,1,I have returned my order still I have not received my refund amount do refund ASAP
2022,5,Best
2022,5,It's superb
2022,1,I didn't get my refund and it's been 1 month since I return my order
2022,1,Worst app they made for themselves BUY THERE CLOTH OFFLINE IS MUCH BETTER
2022,5,Asthetic ♡♡♡ Best shopping ever 🤩
2022,1,Pathetic login denied
2022,1,It's updating when i deleted the app and i can't update any of my other apps now...
2022,1,Did not got refund in six days.Their Refund Form Site Is not Working. Their toll free no is busy all the time of the day..worst online shopping experience ever.
2022,2,"The last attempt to order was extremely disappointing. The order was not successful, but the account was debited for the amount of the order. This was followed by contacting the customer service and contacting my bank. In the meantime, I ordered the same items again, but from the website and everything went fine. It has been 8 days since then and the order is still being processed. I don't think that discounts can and should affect orders that much."
2022,5,"The quality is kind of average (except the premium selections) but it is worth for the price that you are paying for it. My go-to brand when I need essentials or basics. The app works flawlessly, most of the time. Albeit, I have seen that the delivery takes longer as compared to Zara and M&S."
2022,5,Guys online zada better hai
2022,1,Not yet
2022,2,The payment gateway is little problematic.
2022,1,Terrible app doesn't allow me to even log in!! All the money in the world and they can't get this one simple thing right!
2022,5,Purrfectttt packing & gr8 shipping which was on time.
2022,1,"Items get randomly canceled after order is placed and the amount is deducted and its the worst when you buy these items at the sale price. When I checked after a few hours, the items were very much in stock! And to top this, it's takes a lot of time (hours sometimes) to get connected to a customer agent over a call or via chat and they just keep saying it's an app glitch & to order again, without discounts. This has happened with 5 of my orders. Never placing an order on the H&M app again."
2022,1,Very bad online experience. No order tracking and delivery timelines are not taken care of. Pathetic online service. The customer service executives also are not very helpful. They raise complaint when asked for order but that gets delayed and there's no update on orders.
2022,1,"Literally the worst app ever, they have so many technical errors it's ridiculous, I've been waiting to get a refund on my order since 2 weeks and still haven't received it."
2022,1,"I must say h&m's customer service is worst, I have been trying to contact them since 2 days and no one is picking up my call, even chat service is very slow you have to wait for so long and after waiting also their system gets glitch. Refunds policy also sucks other brands like zara, nykaa they Refund within 4-5 days but hnm takes a month to refund seriously. Now also I'm calling them since 1 hr no 1 is picking up , such a big brand I guess they but can't afford enough employees it seems."
2022,5,Speedy delivery
2022,5,I love shoopping at H&M store. They always have new and trendy variety & their app is perfect for online shopping.
2022,1,"Taking orders, but same pincode unserviceable for return -- what nonsense is this? Ordered 3 pyjamas of 6-9 months, one is small compared to other 2, but not able to return as it says pincode unserviceable, try after ""few days"". So I need to track when pincode becomes serviceable again? What if it doesn't, and return window gets closed? App is taking new orders for same pincode!!"
2022,5,Incredible experience in love with the quality....
2022,1,Extremely disappointed!!!! Haven't received my refund of the order which got cancelled on its own. It's been 1 month. I talked with customer service 4 times. Now the number is continuously busy. Worst service ever!!!!!!
2022,1,"Can't log in as clicking ""Sign In"" does absolutely nothing. Every time I scan the QR code to redeem 40 points per bag of clothes recycled, I have to log in again too. That's annoying."
2022,5,I like the style
2022,2,"I get that it's not programmers fault that one of the ritchest fast fashion monsters is ""optimizing"" on their labour. And the result is this (cr)app. There is a complete mess in products catalogue. Numbers are package numbers not the actual product. Sizing charts are non existent. Model hight tells me absolutely nothing about the fit of the garment for me. Basket errors are a standard. No Googl Pay. Selecting pickup point is a chore. Quick last underwear purchase and off somewhere else. FU H&M"
2022,1,App not working
2022,5,Awesome shopping app
2022,1,I ordered and the payment was successfully charged on my bank account but the app froze and the order was not processed. How can I request for refund if the app doesn't even recognize the payment made?
2022,1,Worst service ever
2022,1,"Stupid trouble someone apps. In iPhone work fine, no hang. But in Android, it's hang/ freeze & cresh. How many time I need to relogin to apps and too much bug in Android apps. Bad Android support. Please fixed this ... Hire a good engineer"
2022,5,Really h&m have great collection ❤💥🤘🏻
2022,1,I purchase few items but one of them I return due to some reason but it almost 1 month but still I did not back my money. So ladies please dont buy anything from this App.
2022,5,It is not for middle class people
2022,1,"Very disappointed with the online purchase experience delivering to Punto ritoro self service. The self service point can only accept certain parcel size. Hm didn't know that. The parcel was big and cannot be delivered to the self service pick up point. 1.why Hm didn't pack the parcel accordingly?just pack them small, fitting the self service point requirement. Amazon does this so well.! 2.why the courier (poste italiane) didn't offer customer to pick up at post office? Or communicate?"
2022,1,"Poor order management, delivery."
2022,5,Good dress for men and women kids best place to shop. Mine fav
2022,5,I love h&m make me your brand ambassador..
2022,1,So much glitches and bugs You cannot track your orders from the app. Whenever you like something it doesn't get added to your favorites. Most of the time app crashes or under maintenance..
2022,1,Sucks in delivery. It's been quite a few days and i still don't know where is my order. Chat box always leave the chat.
2022,5,Nice
2022,4,Plz improve your contacting service
2022,1,I made a payment to purchase 2 items and my account was debited with the amount but no order was booked. No record of my order status or payment on the app. Highly disappointed and the app lags a lot when making a purchase.
2022,1,I am frustrated this apps I order pack of 5 vest but i received 1 vest and company say you return product i return product but refund not received after 10 days
2022,1,I ordered a product which was cancelled due to some technical issues. I called h&m for my refund but since that time it's been 50 days now my money is still not refunded. I have written so many mails & even called so many of them but every time I get to hear the same lame excuses wait for 7-8 day. I seriously did not expect h&m brand for such fraudulent of money. I can tell this and I even have so many mails on this. They are not refunding my money. I want to take this on upper level.
2022,4,"This is my first online shopping experience with H&M , though i did offline shopping, super excited ....👍😀"
2022,1,Very bad quality cloths
2022,5,I love the styles and prices very much!
2022,5,👍👍👍👍👍👍
2022,1,"Pathetic experience. They don't have exchange options. Plus they don't reply to emails also. They just have good brand names customer satisfaction doesn't matter at all to them. I have been sending mails since almost more than a month but it doesn't make any difference to them. Big zero from my size. Not even 1 star. Just bcoz I love the brand reluctantly would buy otherwise, the management of website is worst. No international brands have such slow processes."
2022,1,Hm is a scammer i return an item and it is over a month and I didn't get my refund
2022,5,one of the best brand out there!!!
2022,1,Order Delay they taking too much time to deliver
2022,1,"For an international brand, this is the worst app. I would like to give 0 stars. I have placed orders, no confirmation and the money is deducted. Also it keeps logging out. I expected more. Very disappointed."
2022,1,This is the worst application I have ever seen I recommend u too all don't purchase anything from this application customer service is very poor.
2022,5,It gives surprise coupens
2022,1,Why do our account always got logout even if we don't please fix this
2022,1,"Why is it so hard to get my money back. I have returned an order a week ago, yet I am unable to get my money back. While with other apps like Amazon and Myntra, they refund your money instantly. However, with H&M, i am calling up to the customer care, where the effort is futile as nobody picks up and mailing yet no revert. When can I expect my refund?"
2022,5,Excellent collection n quality
2022,5,Veryeeeeee nice
2022,1,Superb
2022,2,The clothes are good but the app is so frustrating and useless!! Takes more than 10 days to deliver any product and the return and refund process is even more frustrating. I'm unable to return a product since so many days because apparently my pincode is not accessible!! I mean What the hell!!!!!!
2022,5,Good app good service
2022,1,Pathetic experience! I have made an order but the delivered item was wrong size and one was uncomfortable to wear. Therefore I opted return in the app and the items were picked up the very next day. It's been a week but there is no update in the app or by message. The app is showing 'Return' option even after the item is returned. There is no information on where the returned item is or when I will get the refund. The app is giving completely wrong information!
2022,5,Would like the option of sort by discount 😉
2022,1,Payment pushed through but order didn't. Terrible first experience.
2022,1,Payment is sucks. Its fails every time after money got debit.
2022,5,Good
2022,3,Ok ok
2022,5,"Good,we need more items in India"
2022,2,It doesn't allow me to login in my account. I have created 2 different account and same problem I faced on both accounts
2022,1,"Doesn't open in one go, doesn't track your delivery."
2022,1,"Worst app ever, log in problem.. After setting new password again and again, still couldn't manage to log in.. and customer service also unable to help. They also don't know what is happening with their app."
2022,2,"Check your filters and your terminologies for the products. Calling Slider, Shoes, won't make them shoes 😂"
2022,5,I cant login fix this asap
2022,5,Best
2022,4,This shopping app is the best given the price and the quality.🥰🥰❤️
2022,1,"I've just changed phones and while in H&M, decided to put the app on my phone. It didn't even recognise my password, so I changed it. The app still won't let me in. It's rubbish!"
2022,1,Horrible experience regarding the refund. It's been over 3 months now and I still haven't received my refund even after calling multiple times to the customer care. Very disappointed in this company customer care.
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Awesome
2022,2,"Though h&m is a very famous and adored brand but when it comes to online site of it, either it's facing too many glitches or maximum times the products are out of stock and that's the BIGGEST ISSUE. On top of that i don't why restocking takes them what like an enormous amount of time. Plus if someone thinks of waiting for even an hr or so to choose some other products to get all things delivered together the product in that minimal time itself again gets out of stock- v.v. IRRITATING. SOLVE ASAP"
2022,2,A trecut mai bine de o saptamana si comanda e inca in stadiul de procesare😐
2022,1,Dont Ever Install This App.This People Are Fraud.While Placing Order Through Card Payment They Will Deduct Ur Money & Ur Order Wont Be Placed Due To Error.If U Contact Customer Care They Will Not Answer Ur Call.U Wont Get Ur Refund As Well.Its Been 15 Days I Haven't Received My Refund Yet.They Don't Even Respond To Ur Mails.Just Pathetic.
2022,1,"See, this is a app where you can find damn good clothes keeping aside the quality of some t-shirts btw this app has some damn good fashion styles but this app is broken.. and if you want to buy something then don't buy from this app coz they take more than 15-20 days to deliver (from my personal experiences) and the customer care service is just there for name sake... Once you'll start telling them your problem they'll just leave the chat.. buy H&M clothes from Myntra or their offline store."
2022,5,Nice app
2022,5,"The best way to shop wherever you are, whenever you want! But"
2022,1,Poor quality
2022,1,"Worst experience ever with online shopping, Not able to return the product from past five days. it shows not available in your area where they have delivered very easily its main area of the Pune city middle of the city they can deliver but can't pickup from there, how that does work it's totally show that H&M now fooling the people by falls promise of the return option, no customer support is there, chat bot is totally useless not getting any help."
2022,1,Takes 4 days to pack a single shirt and they charge Rs 149 per delivery. This is a joke.
2022,5,"Awesome experience, I am super duper happy 👍"
2022,5,Nice app
2022,1,I have reset my password multiple times and tried uninstalled-reinstalled the app it seems there's some weird error somewhere I can't get into my account. Hope it get fixed soon. Thanks
2022,5,My favourite
2022,5,Best 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
2022,1,Delivery time is late maximum time is complete but order is not dispatch and coustomer service agent not answering
2022,2,My wishlist and cart automatically clears up all the time. It's frustrating.
2022,5,Best clothes
2022,5,Overall I am a satisfied user
2022,5,Near and cheap but nice items.
2022,2,App is only for window shopping Order keeps failing but payment gets completed And there's a message displayed deep under on a screen that suggest buying from their website Customer care chatbox sucks too
2022,1,My order was supposed to be delivered on July 14th and it is not yet delivered. The status is saying wrong address. But the irony is they have delivered other products with the same address. If you can't deliver cancel the order and refund my amount
2022,5,It has such good clothes and I love the app and how it works
2022,1,"App says to download the latest version before ordering. OK - went to Google Play, there is no update, I guess I have the latest one. Made the order, money went through immediately, but the order did not! Customer service says you have to UNINSTALL the app you have and the install it again. Ther eis no update. OK did that too. Opened the app and it says the same ""Download new app"" s***. Money gone and so is my affection for H&M and their app."
2022,1,"Would not recommend this app, No updates on orders , very poor delivery."
2022,5,Very nice
2022,1,"I haven't try using it yet. I saw the reviews and the highest review here is 2 stars. Most of the complaints is about payment,delayed orders,no refund. H&M better fix this. I installed this app for the purpose of online shopping yet, with those reviews how will I trust that those issues won't happen to me."
2022,1,Poor delivery and customer support. Work on it guys
2022,5,👍🏽👍🏽
2022,5,Nice authentic online shopp
2022,2,"I think the H&M people doesn't value customers at all. If u place an order using guest, your money will be deducted and u will not receive order confirmation and one more thing is, customer service is worst. They dont answer properly. My money got debited, no refund, no delivery. Waste of time. I donno how come the international brands like this, do fake promises and play with customers."
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Nice shopping app
2022,1,App won't open
2022,1,Your order gets cancelled all the time... And tht too after makin you wait for 10days
2022,1,"It is not about the app but staff and customer services offered by the H &M in Switzerland. You definitely need to check how staff of H&M Switzerland treating their customers. Worst experience ever, you have lost one customer for sure. Never going to shop again. This is not acceptable"
2022,1,"amount got deducted but order didn't got placed, it has been 9 days and haven't received the refund!"
2022,5,I love this app ...especially the sales never have or had a problem with this app...the items are shipped fast the quality of the clothes are great.sum things i find online i cant find in the store ..and sum things i find in the store i cant find online ..i think they should have customer apperication month ...and post their top buyers ....and maybe a mix and match on their buy 2 get 1 free at the same equal price or lower price..also have scratch off cards on the site to get discounts on clothe
2022,1,"There is lots of issue with this which is obviously not helpful at all.... I love this store but this app is so hectic to use, refunds not on time, no one to reply to chat, there is always a technical glitch in the app, return is so hectic and many more to count on..... I emailed twice to the customer service regarding a refund issue but there is no response.... This is not expected from reputed firm like h&m"
2022,1,Customer care misbehaving never buy they don't return your money
2022,1,Worsted service of h&m worst experience shopping with online h$m
2022,1,Worst Delivery experience ever 😡 I ordered overshirt for special occasion of my birthday..it shows will be delivered in 2-7 days but after 7th day it is still in warehouse and preparing for dispatch 😡 my birthday falls on 19th of july ...H&M makes it worst ..This is my first buying experience from H&M and Brand totally ruined it 😡😡 ...Shame on you H&M ..When I contacted customer service they sorry to me and request me to wait 3-4 days then my order will dispatch and birthday will over #Shame
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,Obsessed ❤😍
2022,1,Stupidest shopping app! It's been 3 months and I still don't have my refund. Customer service is poor.
2022,1,Worst experience... Ordered a pack of two shirts and recieved only one... Raised a complaint and it's been 24 days now and counting no response... Contacts doesn't work... Live agent assures that the refund would be initiated within 2-3 days and it's been more than 24 days now.... They will take your money in a minute but take more than 24 days to refund an amount that too because of an error from there end! FU h&m return my money back asap
2022,1,That app is terrible. I created an account on the website and tried logging in on my phone and it locked my account for suspicious activity. I created a new account on the phone and that worked. Picked out a few things and went to check out but was somehow logged out and wouldn't let me log back in.
2022,1,"Auto log out from my actual account,and bug to sign in"
2022,4,It has come a long way.
2022,4,Only they need to improve and work on it is delivery because they takes so much time to deliver a package i hope they consider my suggestion and work on it
2022,1,"Delivery takes too long and they don't refund even after 2 months, they don't connect calls when called on customer service, don't know how to receive my refund"
2022,3,The payment should have more option rather than just credit cards. Another feature suggestions would be searching the tops/dress/pants etc whether there are available at HnM nearest store.
2022,1,They don't value their customers.
2022,5,I love this aap
2022,5,Thanks for shipping in Leh Ladakh ❤️❤️❤️
2022,1,"Very bad experience and pathetic customer care. App is smooth, only issue is with order and payments. After ordering from the app, the items got cancelled automatically without any intimation through sms. Payment got debited, still no refund from their side and from past 14 days continuously following up with them still no proper response or communication, forget about refund. Very disappointed, never expected this from popular brand 😕"
2022,1,"Don't shop from this app, delayed deliveries,"
2022,1,Error page and not loading
2022,4,"Online store app is okay. H&M, offer a wide selection of clothing in store, and online for all ages. However, the kids section is limited and expensive. Try, Shein online for a kids collection and price."
2022,1,Changed my password but everything I try to log in it goes back to the original password. Cannot sign in :(
2022,1,"Horroble experience with the app. Has many bugs. I am trying to change the password since so many days multiple times, still no response. Pathetic app"
2022,5,Excellent
2022,5,Superb
2022,1,"Gave me no noticed that they were resetting my points, and lost out on all the points I just accumulated over the weekend before it resetted."
2022,3,"Regularly just deletes all my favorites. It's new and very annoying! Please fix, other than that never had an issue. Please give me my 5☆ experience back 🙏🏼"
2022,1,Tried to order i was deducted but my order did not push thru its still on my cart
2022,5,Good experience
2022,5,Awesome.
2022,1,Worst experience ever. They don't confirm order even after payment. Told me to put fresh order with COD and then cancelled my order on their own
2022,1,"Worst Customer Service. My reward voucher cant use (empty). When customer service called, they give online purchase instead of in-store use. This is my 2nd time cant use the voucher. And no solution fr CS end. Very frustrated."
2022,2,Order always delayed...
2022,5,Bestest store for outfit purchases
2022,4,"I'll give 4 start cause overall is good, dissapointed is taking a very long time to refund, need to improve in 'refund system'."
2022,1,Page navìgation is a
2022,5,I personally love h&m.. they give such a great offers which are really so so helpful to us.. there quality of products and the style that they keep making is just mind blowing really loving it
2022,1,They won't even contact and help! They have not sent the refund for an order after more than a month now! Worst service ever!
2022,1,Don't buy cheap service cheap product
2022,1,Robbers. First give wrong product. Then dont refund back money even after a month. Dont reply to email queries. Chat box even worst. Very unpleasant experience. Disgusting !!!!!!
2022,1,Worst coustomer care services
2022,5,It is the best
2022,4,Good
2022,5,Best clothing hands down!
2022,5,Amazing product at such a reasonable pricing
2022,1,I've lost 515 points for no reason! I've sent an email but I got no response. Worst app ever.
2022,1,Clothes are good but Shopping experience is bad Coupons once used cannot be used again even if the order is cancellled . Birthday coupon given but doesnt work .
2022,5,My fav
2022,1,Why is it available here if it doesn't provide to india
2022,1,Does not respond - just hangs
2022,5,Amazing 🤩
2022,5,"Excellent packaging and quick delivery. H & M clothings are also very comfortable to wear, soft and skin friendly fibers/ fabrics.I love H&M.If only payment options have NetBanking tat wud b very convenient for those using them- to make payments during checkout"
2022,4,Everything's good but you can't cancel an order .
2022,1,Je koopt kleren voor bijna 350 € en zij vragen je of je een zak nidig hebt 🤦‍♂️ zelfs als je voor zoveel geld krijg je geen gratis zakje.
2022,5,I think its a very good app but they should keep you logged in all the time and not have to redo it everyday and remove your items.
2022,5,Very good app
2022,1,"Cannot log in. After downloading app I couldn't log into my account, I changed my password ,it still didn't work"
2022,5,I love using this app. The products are nicely packed and are very good. Loved it.
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Love H&M dresses 🤩
2022,5,Perfect.Please upgrade with new items
2022,1,Terrible experience for payment. So many glitches at the time of payment. No net banking option. Server gets stuck in middle. Its so iriitating. Please fix the bugs.
2022,1,Unable to login or reset password.
2022,5,Love the style and material ♥️
2022,3,I've been trying to change my billing address but for some reason I can't change it . Please fix it
2022,1,"Due to a ""glitch in the app,"" at least for Croatian customers, the moment you try to make an order, the app doesn't process the order, but the payment goes through. You are left with no proof of an unsuccessful order, but H&M takes your money anyway. Customer service proved to be of no service at all, and they have refused to give me my money back. The app is useless, as is customer service. So, I suggest using this mobile app only if you want to let H&M steal your money."
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Horrible experience, they don't refund money, terribly costumer services they don't care about your hard earned money"
2022,1,The app is saying that it can not delivered the parcel at your area
2022,1,Your apps SUCK! I CANT EVEN BECOME A MEMBER! STUPID
2022,1,Serv6 of h&m is kind of worst first they take too long to deliver the product and if there is some issue and you want to return the product ghey take a month to return your money.....i mean seriously? Even small sites are way better and faster than h&m
2022,5,love it
2022,1,This app was sucks and their service also. Its hard to get a successful payment and their service was too long to get a reply. Hopefully they could fix their app right away.
2022,5,"Love the app, all quality products."
2022,5,I love this brand but it's not budget friendly for the middle class family to afford the cloth in india. But if the price is going to lower that the brand will still achieve too much success
2022,1,"Payment is the most unavailable thing, the product is always out of stock like how many times it is out of stock I waited for like 1 month for that one product and still not available and also having logins and stuff.. this app has so many drawbacks"
2022,1,"I must say h&m has the most pathetic online service most of the times their app don't work properly,takes long time to refund,the glitch in the app is very common n everytime it happens. Just ordered some stuff no order history is showing payment has been done twice n no refund has been made yet. Improve your app or just shut it down."
2022,5,Sexy
2022,1,"It's a worst app, never use it guys I am telling you it's a worst app, I didn't get my refund 7000 till now.,, I don't like the refund policy, how much this brand is actually earning by making people fool, but still they don't have return and refund policy better., you can get the refund by 30 days. It can be better."
2022,1,"The experience using this app has been horrible, half of the the order I received was defective it took a week to return the clothes as they refused to take it back the first time a week in I only get a half the refund I've been constantly complaining every 2 to 3 days and I still haven't gotten my full refund the customer service keeps telling they've extended the complaint and to wait for 24 to 48 hours it's been a month doing the same routine. Save your time and money and go to a store."
2022,5,"Delivery is faster and the membership discount is also great! I hope they come up with more features for availing discount, servicing is great( I was sceptical about it at first) but it's great actually."
2022,5,Cool
2022,5,Very bad😞😞
2022,5,I really love the customer service And they are really gentle is everything
2022,2,"When I started using its gave response, but now recently whenever I book any order it get confirmed and even money gets deducted, but after sometimes without any reason the order get canceled it happend multiple time with me,l, so what's the point of buying when eventually u are gonna cancel it"
2022,1,"After order confirmation and amount has been cut from my account, the order is canceled stating they did not receive payment confirmation this is very pathetic, kindly do not order from this app. Very disappointing not sure if my money will be back in account."
2022,1,"It has been months and I cannot launch the app as it keeps displaying 'An important service is temporarily unavailable and the app cannot function without it. Please try again later.' *update on 7th July 2022* Decided to try using the app to browse for clothes. Now the app can launch, but I can't sign in with the correct credentials. Incredibly disappointing from H&M marketing team. Anyway, making purchase from Shopback app is better, and additional cashback."
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Nothing like H&M
2022,5,Only source that i found bringing something different in indian market with unbelievable quality of materials and texture
2022,5,Best quality and fit in trousers and jeans
2022,1,"H&m clothes are good but, Please,stop delivery charges 😑. I think, if h&m close their delivery charges. Then it grove very well"
2022,1,I can't open my account!! Suddenly my points disappeared 😕... and if I select any item to buy I can't find it
2022,2,"Payment failing, Order delayed. In the past six months, I have ordered 2-3 times using this app. However, it shows that the payment went through then reverses the payment amount the next day. So I have to login through the website to make the payment. What is the point of having an app if you can't make the purchase here. Also, the app shows items are in stock. However after ordering, the order gets indefinitely delayed. Some orders were.also automatically cancelled without informing via mail."
2022,5,Good
2022,3,Gmail ID login problem 😐😐
2022,3,Thode swast pan det ja 😢
2022,1,This is really a very bad shopping experience... Like they are taking so much time to initiate a refund amount. What kind of policy is this I mean from my last experience I never wanted to shop here again.... They are taking so much time to proceed refund and it's just not so fair.
2022,2,"I cant checkout, then i signed out to try again. Now, I can't sign in. Quite frustrating."
2022,5,The good app
2022,2,I can't login. What's going on? I enter my credentials and keeping pressing login. But nothing happens.
2022,1,Credit card payment failed. What's the use of this app when you wont let us buy thru it
2022,3,Some stuffs are out of stock for long time.
2022,1,Its refund policy is very useless. I feel like they has cheated with me.
2022,5,Best..
2022,5,Perfect
2022,5,Nice
2022,4,"Hi There, I recently ordered the 3 sweatshirt from this app on 1 july 22 and I received the same today. But payment not deducted from my bank. Kindly reach out to me for payment."
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Horrible app. Everytime you order there is an issue with online payment which gets deducted and the order doesn't get placed.
2022,1,Not able to login
2022,3,"I find it annoying that every time I go to the app, everything I add to my favorites, or to my cart, gets deleted."
2022,5,💕

2022,5,Best 😍
2022,5,Still love H&M Worked here with great pleasure for 20 years!
2022,1,Very worst service
2022,1,So I have been facing few issues regarding the membership think and NO HELP from the customer service team! I tried mailing and calling but no help at all.. poor customer service
2022,2,I cannot even proceed to payment. Error happens which says I am not authorized to view the page. Customer service is no help. Disappointing experience.
2022,5,H&m collection and quality 💯💯
2022,1,"Very bad first experience, amount deducted from card but order not placed on app."
2022,1,Worst store ever still i didn't got my refund back i returned my product on 16 June Y delaying thiss much I too need money 🙂 for living
2022,1,The application's user experience is extremely poor with payment process and customer service. I made a purchase online but there's nothing showing in my purchase history. It's been over 24hours that I have sent few mails to your customer service but no response at all.
2022,1,Idk what to say. I just downloaded the app and am trying to buy some stuff but the app won't let me become a member. I've been clicking on the button several times but still no response. Plz help
2022,5,Wonder ful
2022,1,Always bugging.. providing offers and coupons. Whenever I apply and pay. Payment got deducted and coupon availed but order is cancelled later. Not able to use the coupon later. Experienced this for more than 5 times in a shirt period.
2022,1,"Cannot pay with card in app .. tried it twice for different orders set apart couples of weeks. Had to call customer service, and my bank also - because the money was blocked, but order never placed. Also, no share button for items in 2022? Meh"
2022,4,This app product and everything was great but login experience is bad you really need to work on it please fix i hope so you can respond this review thinks.
2022,5,Reasonable and best quality product
2022,5,Fast and user friendly app
2022,1,Horrendous experience! The return and refund process is such a hassle. They don't intimate you with proper emails and you have got to keep calling them over and over again to get an update. It's been more than 3 weeks and I have no update on my refund. Even to connect with the Customer support desk you have got to try them at least tens of times. Would never recommend!!!
2022,1,Worst app ever trying to replace my order from 4 days now as the size is too small for me but I am unable to. Wasted my money never going to buy anything from this brand. Even the costumer service is pathetic not picking up the call and you can just hear the pre recorded call.
2022,5,Just awesome
2022,5,I like to shoping to h&m but exchange is not available

If i call their customercare they say that i only filled for one return that to after they mailed me that they recived my parcel 30 days prior, if i ask them what abot the 2nd one ,they say that its been refunded,if i ask them for transaction id,as i cant seem to see the numbers reflecting in my account,they say it would take 3 days and now its 15 day since."
2022,5,Nice...classy stuffs
2022,5,Affordable price available
2022,2,"Its a really good app and it has amazing clothes but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that every single time i add things to my cart, close the app and when I open the app again it shows that my shopping bag is empty. It happens every time. Please remove this ridiculous bug from the app"
2022,1,bad service on delivery dates order tracking
2022,5,Good collections
2022,4,Lovely ❣️❣️
2022,5,Best app
2022,5,Love H & M ❤️
2022,5,excellent
2022,1,Tried to place an order. The app ate my money but the order didn't place. Been more than 21 days still didn't get any refund
2022,1,They are not refunding the returned item money.....nd the customer care was telling that we count find your account.... worst app🤬🤬
2022,5,great clothes
2022,1,"It only has a US option, and not Canadian"
2022,1,First purchase were fine. As i started to repeat for my second purchase the apps keep rejecting everytime i proceed online payment. Until now. Really bad. 👎
2022,1,"Item Always out of stock,, guys you have any tipe of lock 🔒 for for your Store"
2022,2,"The search by picture doesn't work, and it keeps deleting my things from cart and liked items"
2022,1,"Utter garbage. Registration does not work, everything else is super slow"
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,It really makes me happy
2022,5,Amazing products with superb quality. Great clothing application ever!
2022,5,Awesome
2022,5,It's just amazing I love it
2022,5,Awesome
2022,4,Website is pretty Slow !
2022,5,No fuss application.
2022,1,"worst shopping app ever.. i returned my product and i haven't got the refund till now.. its been 1 and a half month now.. When i contacted the customer service i was told the money has been initiated but.. i never received the money.. and when i asked for my utr number.. they just kept on telling me to wait for 24 hours and now their 24 hours is 1 month already... Worst, worst app ever..👎👎👎 They have robbed me."
2022,5,Good quality
2022,1,App is at all good. Even after the payment deduction order is not placed and when I again tried to check the order it was processed under cod mode. Pathetic customer service who suggest that don't go for online payment instead of acknowledging the actual issue.
2022,4,"I'm in love with you H&M😌💗. All the facilities in the app I loved it ,like the way of searching , the nearby store facilities , the customer service , everything ❤️. And the quality of the clothes are also so good. And I want you to know how much I appreciate the excellent service you provided ,Your attention to detail, great communication skills 👍🏼"
2022,5,Great
2022,2,The size chart for all products is confusing. The app is not intuitive. Most sizes are almost always unavailable. Do these people really want us to purchase from them or they just want to display their products?
2022,1,"Placed an order, money got deducted. It didn't show in the app. When I contacted the customer care, they said the order is not being placed and I'll get the refund but will have to order again. Such a waste of time. Very inconvenient."
2022,1,"For some reason it does not accept me as a client. I can use any payment option it always say error RM1. To talk with h&m is impossible and they replied my email saying to uninstall the app, to clear my browser history, to use other internet connections but anyway if I use my email for the purchase it never complete the selling. The worst: I can see no support from them and I feel stupid begging for their attention just to give them my money. My advice is DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
2022,5,H&M has his own unique style with good quality clothes. Always the best option for all occasions.
2022,5,Nice
2022,1,Paid amount but order not reflecting in my order list
2022,5,Very good i like the products but it's little expensive.
2022,5,Very good products
2022,2,Functionality of the app is poor
2022,1,I am returned a order Nd i didn't get the refund in my bank account ... It has been more than 1 month after the exchange
2022,2,"Such a worst app,cannot change delevery method and not able to order anything,facing this problem since month"
2022,5,My all time favourite brand h&m 🥺💯
2022,1,Your refund policy sucks!!!!
2022,2,Payment problem. Payment deducted but order not processed. Happened 2 times over 3 days. Next time i used their website instead of app
2022,1,Made 2 orders with my card last friday and am still waiting for my refund as the orders did not go trough 😢
2022,5,Amazing app and fast delivery absolutely love ❤
2022,4,The app crashes when I press on Alle anzeigen in Meine Angebote
2022,5,Good

2022,5,Love it.......💙💙
2022,1,"I'm tired of ordering and paying online to just witness money being deducted and order not being placed! They keep telling to wait for the refund, so freaking tiring, done with this!!!"
2022,3,"I really love the products, but I would like h&m to install replace options too. There is no replace options to replace the item. Anyways loved it."
2022,5,❤️
2022,5,Best shopping app

2022,5,Good
2022,1,Worst app worst customer care . I am disappointed.
2022,5,H&M is always best
2022,1,"Unable to login. I placed an order few days ago, needed to exchange due to size problem. My phone changed, and now I can't login. I tried forgot password but no email is sent. I even checked the spam. No customer care is a valid number."

2022,5,Very good app .. product quality was high
2022,1,"Really bad refund policy. Sir, if you're reading this then i want my money Back otherwise i have to do case in it.if somebody is refunding think before you do🙂"
2022,5,I love to buy clothes from here
2022,1,the navigation does not work - or better expressed is not usable - in my xiaomi device in dark mode as it has white background with a white text font
2022,5,💮❤️
2022,5,Best quality products ✌️
2022,1,"If I can rate this app zero, I would. Orders are not going through yet they charge you. It's a hassle because you still have to dispute to the bank and the process is painfully long. Never use this app!"
2022,2,Worst with the refund system I haven't received my refund till now I returned the order on 25th May It is showing that warehouse hasn't processed .. it's annoying
2022,3,Best app! But the problem is that I can't make any membership account 🤔
2022,5,Good quality and Best product..
2022,1,All of Türkiye and arab world are against PRIDE
2022,5,Since lockdown I have only got H&M and Its the best. Better and cheaper than Zara
2022,5,"The only brand whom I trust ..,🙏"
2022,1,Used to be a very good app but apparently for the past few orders they keep saying I've got to log in and cut the money from my account and not refunding which I would have to pay with cash on delivery therefore I pay twice the amount
2022,1,HM You suck! Your refund policy sucks! Likewise your app.
2022,4,Why no h&m showroom in jaipur (rajasthan).
2022,5,"For me, it's the best place for shopping in the world."
2022,5,Love it!
2022,5,Wow! The best quality
2022,5,Excellent collection ☺️
2022,5,Awesome
2022,1,Coupon code issue. I had a 25% off coupon which I have used but payment gets cancelled due to app's error. when I raised this the customer service provide the 10% off coupon to compensate 25%.
2022,5,Affordable but mind blowing too. Thank YOU ☺️
2022,3,My most favorite brand
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,Big brand but their app is so bad. There is always the issue with the app. My amount got deducted and the order did not get placed and the store has no idea about it. Such big brand having stores across the world but cannot hire good app developers.
2022,1,H&m always sent wrong color . And there are no exchange system . You have to return it and wait a month for refund. Very bad experience. Will never shop again
2022,1,Money got deducted twice but order was not placed due to some issue. Because of this Refunds are taking upto 15 days to get credited back to source which is so annoying.
2022,5,Fabulous

2022,1,"worst brand they are not refunding money if we don't have bank or not even giving another order in the change of returned order. And they don't even gives another option if we are in trouble, the service is worst then others."
2022,1,"Worst fashion app. Not able to place an order. I have tried to place order 3 times, the amount got deducted but no order confirmation. Wishlist, Cart everything in this app has bugs."
2022,1,Worst app ever. It placed my orders 2 different times. My money got deducted both the times but my order never got placed. Didn't receive my refund yet . When will I get it back ?

2022,2,"Is it just mine or everyone else's. H&M is not at all working in my phone. Like everytime I open the app, it says H&M is temporarily closed, we are busy updating the stock for you. Like literally for about a month now. What is this! I love this app but now it's just disappointing to even just think about it."
2022,1,"The app is so buggy, multiple times now I've been locked out and it blocks my IP address so I can't even access the website on my laptop either... Its so stupid. It also takes ages for it to get sorted out, unsure why it keeps happening to me?... I love H&m but it's seriously putting me off the whole brand, just can't browse and it stems from nothing, I'm just acting like a regular shopper. So dumb."
2022,1,"Always failed during payment, Purchases failed and credit card still deducted. Very Terrible"
2022,4,"The ux of the app is degraded on phone in dark mode, have you not checked the app's ux when phone is set on dark mode?"
2022,2,"Cel mai prost magazin de haine, se vede prin tricourile albe"

2022,5,Good
2022,1,Third class company. I have returned my item on 27 even they delivered wrong item. Still I have not received my refund. I have called them more than 5 times. No support nothing. Fake company.
2022,4,"ze seznamu oblíbenýcb produktů mi stále dokola samy od sebe mizí věci, ne jen jedna, ale vždy zmizí celý seznam"
2022,1,"This was my first order from your application because I was not able to find my size in store and needed a trouser urgently and guess what after paying 1800 rupees and waiting for 5 days, i have received this totally crushes trouser with no tag and it seems as it's thrifted or old, very much disappointed from your service, I want this to return and initiate my refund."
2022,2,"After a store transaction , my app is suddenly not working properly. No vouchers or recycle bonus is appearing on the screen."
2022,1,"Whenever i open this app to order something it keeps getting loggedout. And when I try to login, it shows this email is already used try another. I tried so many times but this isn't working at all. Please fix this ASAP!!"
2022,5,Great! Easy app to use and very good prices
2022,5,Great!
2022,1,"Serious issue in the app, after entering the otp on the payment page, it gets backs to a logged out page on the app with amount getting deducted and order NOT being placed"

2022,3,"Placed an order on the app, the order didn't go through but my money did. Twice. Please fix this bug."
2022,5,Excellent
2022,5,Hjj
2022,1,Worst app. Feels like fraud. I ordered few products and the amount got debited from my bank account but nothing is displayed in Orders instead there are products still showing in the cart. Kindly look into this matter as it is related to money.
2022,2,"I am a plus member , everything is great in this app except one thing , the best products are always out of stock"
2022,1,can't place an order
2022,1,This app is terrible..my money got struck three times ..don't use it .if u want buy..buy it in store..worst app..I'm fed up
2022,4,Worst experience ever. It's been more than 15 days I haven't received my refund yet. Pathetic customer service.
2022,1,We love low quality but high price
2022,1,"What's is happening, can't track my order, i have updated version of the app"
2022,5,Absolutely love the brand and the app!
2022,4,Marvelous
2022,1,not opening
2022,1,"I' m very disappointed with this app, made a payment this morning and the money has been debited from my account and no confirmation that your order has been placed or not and unable to check from the app that my order is confirmed or not, till day end if there is no confirmation then I will raise a dispute for the payment."
2022,2,H&m clothes quality in india is degrading day by day. Even they send used clothes which has odour smell and looks dirty.
2022,2,Cancelation process not so good
2022,5,Fantastic easy to use app' with great consumer benefits 😊
2022,5,Is it available in India?
2022,3,Expensive
2022,1,"Pathetic App Ever !!! They only deduct the money from your account and the Order does not even go through..Even after numerous complaints they still have not issued me the Refund of funds deducted from my Card, and this has happened thrice till now..At first I thought it was my Card but no it's this worst App."
2022,1,"App is very well made but something seriously wrong with after payment pages and confirmation of order, just placed an order and got the payment done got mail from bank regarding the amount deduction, went back to app in account section no orders shown... Still the cart was showing the items.. what's the next step... Received the deducted amount back.. but will not be shopping via the app."
2022,3,🤘
2022,5,Osm products
2022,4,It ok to use
2022,5,Good. But product goes out of stock fast and never comes back. Plus please notify if if comes back.
2022,1,"Bad customer experience! I don't suggest buying using the app. First of all they send the wrong product, and they don't have option to replace. So you have to apply for refund and the vicious cycle of bad customer support starts. I am yet to receive any refunds of the product that was taken back 2.5 months ago."
2022,1,Order not showing in my purchase tab .....and money deducted from my bank account fix this issue 😡🤬
2022,5,Very good app
2022,1,"The email and password i use to log into the website shows invalid on the app, meaning i can never log in. I tried changing the password on the web version and the problem persists. Cannot imagine what is going wrong here."
2022,5,This is very good app ❤thanks h&m
2022,1,"Impossible to make purchase. You can add all items to shopping card. Proceed ro payment, bank reserves your money for days. But purchase with HM never happens. Tried several times. At the end 3 amounts for hm was frozen from my bank account for days. But no order happens. Customer service doesn't helps. They believe that app works great:("
2022,1,"The app was good previously. But now, the payment are always stuck. I ordered previously and my payment got deducted but my order was not processed. Today also the same thing happened. The customer service say it will be refunded..but why this problem. This has happened thrice. It is so annoying, you can't order anything from this app."
2022,2,"Everything worked well, but now I can't log into my account login and password are correct but it always shows error. That's annoying 😒"
2022,5,Nice
2022,4,Overall good
2022,2,"La app es muy buena pero el servicio de entrega ha sido muy malo; antes ofrecían envío gratis en compras de 899+ y llegaba en 3 días aproximadamente, ahora llega en 2 semanas, o si prefieres pagar te llega en 3 a 5 días."
2022,5,Cea mai buna aplicație de haine de pana acum 🥰
2022,5,Nice clothes
2022,1,"WARNING! This app is BOGUS! We tried to buying things from this app but after entering our OTP code it directed us to the language settings for some unknown reason and when we went back to the main page everything we placed in your cart is still here. NO INDICATION THAT THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED. UNTIL YOU CHECK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. THEY TOOK OUR MONEY BUT NO NOTIFICATION, EMAIL OR INDICATION THAT THE TRANSACTION WAS MADE!"
2022,1,"This app is filled with bugs. Payments are not going through. Forced to choose Cash on Delivery. Amount gets debited from the card, but order is not created. Very disappointing."
2022,1,Most of the times the app doesn't respond right while checking out for payment. It asks to login after the OTP has been entered for payment via card even if we are logged in. The payment gets deducted & yet no order is placed. This is not the first time it's happening. Then we hv to call the customer care & convince/justify them & ask for a refund for the amount deducted from our card for no order placed. Verry irritating & time wasting. Need to improve the apps workability!!!
2022,1,"Terrible shopping experience as of late. I can't check out anything in my cart. I called customer service and I was told to delete then download the app to fix the issue but this did not work. Whenever I try to check out, your app asks me to sign in (even though I am already signed in). Then I'm prompted to start again, items I tried to purchase still in my cart. Right now there are several charges on my card which I have to wait to fall off for several days. Extremely dissapointing"
2022,1,Needed help but no reply from any email or phone.. the virtual assistant always says it's not available at the time to help... Very bad user interface
2022,1,It is the worstt app i had ever use it is fraudddd it doesn't owe the verditcs
2022,2,Please use other payment methods i dont have a visa
2022,5,goede overzicht
2022,5,I have signed in like 4 times still its logging me out again and again I already ordered something will I get it or not?
2022,1,It has so many bugs
2022,4,"This app is good but there is only one problem. Whenever i paid online for my order it doesn't confirm my order even after payment is done,I received the message that money is send successfully but this app show that it didn't received the money and canceled my order. It happened so many time with me and i'm very annoyed about this😑😑"
2022,5,Amazing
2022,1,Very bad does not give refund in a day like myntra neither gives option for returning and buying product for the same price like replacement very bad service and inconvenient.
2022,5,Good
2022,1,One Star for a painful experience to enter and edit address. It so difficult to add an address cuz this stupid app wont allow it you to enter it by will and wont change it easily when required. It took me 90 min and this STUPID app still wont edit my address. Such a simple and vital thing to enter is also dependent on whims of the app. Seriously this ia a joke
2022,1,Don't shop h&m app refund problem
2022,1,I can't find india over it . After reinstalling and updating several times highly disappointed
2022,5,Good best reasonable
2022,5,Good 👍
2022,1,Refund facilities are the worst they don't refund your money I've returned my product it's been more than 2 months now but still i didn't get my refund money
2022,5,Confidently comfortable in H&M Good Quality Clothes 👌
2022,1,"I cant even remove anything from the shopping cart, it just keep coming back and now there is too much stuff in the cart."
2022,5,Average......myntra gives us a little better experience compared to h n m app
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,"This is such an overrated store, I am trying to order one shirt from last 7 days , in app they can't even deliver to area which is in middle of big city, in store there wont be any stock, I'm so vexed with this and never gonna use again"
2022,2,Still haven't received my refund from the company ........and no customer care service
2022,2,Favorited and wishlisted items are regularly deleted/cleared and it is mighty inconvenient and infuriating. Why delete user's wishlisted items??
2022,1,Extremely long waiting time for delivery after shopping online. Never going to buy nothing online from them again!!!
2022,1,"I am unable to complete any orders lately. The checkout process works up to the point where the credit card gets charged, then the app freezes and the order fails. The transaction is then on hold for multiple days until the money is released by the bank. Terrible experience to say the least and customer service has not been helpful at all."
2022,5,Such a cool app very user friendly
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Just satisfied.
2022,2,It keeps deleting my favorites when I save them.
2022,1,I havent recived my return refund...Its been more than 15 days now...I sent an email to their customer service team however no response...worst service
2022,5,😎👍
2022,5,I love this brand and clothes 💓
2022,1,"""An important service is temporarily unavailable and the app cannot function without it. Please try again later."""
2022,5,Extremely good
2022,1,Worse shipping apps ever
2022,3,The app is good.. but they have worst refund policy it's been 9 days and I haven't received my refund.. so think before you return any any item .
2022,2,The app interface is good but the major problem is there is a big glitch on this app which doesn't confirm your order even after your money gets debited. It keeps on redirecting you to check out page. My suggestion is try with website instead.
2022,1,worst customer service 😒
2022,1,VERY VERY POOR WEBSITE IT CANNOT RECOGNIZE ADDRESS
2022,5,💯💯
2022,4,No exchange option.....apart from that amazing service
2022,1,"WORST APP EVER!!!!! I PLACED AN ORDER SO THE PAYMENT WAS DEDUCTED FROM MY DEBIT CARD. THE PROBLEM IS, THE ORDER DIDN'T GO THROUGH. I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE REFUND. THIS APP GIVES ME SO MUCH HEADACHE! PLEASE IMPROVE THE APP AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AS WELL!"
2022,2,"I spent about an hour working with a super sweet employee in store trying to figure out a problem I'm having with this app and it's so frustrating, even the employee didn't know what was wrong. The app never lets me sign in it says that I must have the wrong email or password even though I know I put in the right password and email and to be sure I clicked forgot password and put in my email but it never sends me the link to re-new my password. The website is fine but I will not use the app."
2022,1,Don't use h&m.they are worst in terms of online service. I have been suffering for 12 days.they just give the time again and again but do not resolve the issue.#worst_shopping_app
2022,5,My fav shopping app 🙌
2022,1,"When trying to log-in the App is saying ""wrong email or password"". As the email is not wrong, I hit the ""forgotten password"" option and wait for an email to retrieve/change my password. 3 WEEKS later still waiting.. Tried it several times - no email.... Can't access the App, no email to change the password is received and I can do nothing with the App.. it's useless although created to the benefit of the HM customers....."
2022,2,Some problem keeps occurring with payment. Payment keeps getting deducted but the order doesn't get placed. Happened 2 times.
2022,3,Worst app. It redirects to login page after deducting money. Didnt get order confirmation after card payment or UPI. No chat option with customer service and contact through call is usually busy.
2022,5,Fabulous
2022,1,They have a very bad return policy. It takes almost a month to get your refund back.
2022,1,"The app always always alwaaaays has bugs / errors. I was trying to make an in app purchase and it won't let me complete my purchase. I uninstalled / reinstalled the app, even restarted my phone, and it didn't help whatsoever. So disappointed!!!"
2022,5,Superb service. Online delivery quick and return is also hassle free. My experience with H&m has always been pleasant. I trust this brand and their online delivery service is easy-to-use.
2022,5,By far best shopping experience in the mass market sector
2022,1,the return and refund service is so disappointing. they takes a whole month to refund your money. and you have to constantly contact their customers service regarding this after that you get your refund after a month 😡😡😡😡
2022,5,Gives the best style
2022,1,The slowest refund journey I returned my stuff and its been weeks now. Still no refund is processed. Please speed up your refund services if you dont want to lose customers
2022,1,Never ever buying anything from H&M it took months to refund ur cash n delivery process is very slow like snail 🐌🐌if plz if u wanna buy anything from H&M use other app don't order anything from this mf app deserve 0 zero star Rremove this app from playstore.
2022,1,Really buggy app. Money gets debited but the order doesn't get placed. False data is shown for instock and out of stock items. This app needs a lot of work. Please hire better engineers.
2022,5,Good
2022,1,I really had a very bad experience... I had not received my refund.. Itz already 20 days but no refund was initiated.. I had also send emails several times regarding my issue but no response.. I am so disappointed with hnm plz don't purchase anything from this app.. If you want to purchase tha u can go to myntra atlst they will return your refund.
2022,5,Affordable shopping.
2022,1,"Amount Debited from Account but no order id generated. Worst application, also their customer support is very less responsive."
2022,1,Can't find India as region.
2022,1,They don't have good collections for women
2022,5,Improve your refund procedure. It takes forever
2022,1,Return process is worst. You get refund after 20 days of pickup. So irritating.
2022,5,Maja hi aagaya
2022,1,"To begin with I thought this was a fairly good app, but a) it caps your favourites and b) constantly just deletes everything in your favourites or your bag if you leave the app for a second for no reason. I was using it to plan out the things I was going to purchase for my new house. What a waste of time. Won't be buying anything now after that as I can't find them all again!"
2022,1,Изключително неприятно за употреба приложение. За пореден път имам проблем с вписването
2022,1,Whenever i save my favourites in wishlist I never find them saved in the list . It's so annoying. Can you please fix this
2022,5,Very good nesds more ladies behide the tills
2022,3,This year's collection isn't it. Plus it's getting more expensive I think. And why the few things I like are always out of stock?
2022,1,I place return order on 13 may order reach warehouse house but still not received refund
2022,1,"So slow to dispatched the parcel from warehouse.....not like other online shopping apps. What the heck is this H&M?Why even so much taking time in refunding money of those return products?Never to order again from H&M, heating me up."
2022,1,H & m app is not working.
2022,5,I love h&m products!..

2022,2,I cant seem to change my delivery method no matyer what i do. I have been buying from this shop through the app but howcome this problem just occured now. Hope they fix it right away.
2022,1,I have no objection with product but the refund process takes too long tym and don't even refund money.Worst experience ever.
2022,5,Good
2022,1,It never works and always crashes
2022,1,Amount deducted for purchase made but no check out of the purchase or any details available. Even small scale online retailers have better shopping apps and user friendly then H&M. I've been asked to wait for resolutions or refund by mail. Just hope my money is refunded soon.
2022,1,"Не отчита последните ми две покупки/ не ми дава съответните точки за направените покупки и не мога да си взема ваучера заради това. Чакам от 2 дни, касовите бележки са отразени, но не ми дава точки."
2022,1,"The app sucks. I placed two orders on 20th May 2022. The order didn't get placed but the amount was deducted both times. On contacting the customer service, they said it's an application glitch. I haven't received the refund yet and they keep saying that they have escalated the issue."
2022,1,Worst app ever. I try to make online payment but my money gets deducted everytime without the order being places and they won't refund it untill 14days. What a useless app
2022,2,"Everything is good about this app but delivery agent are nightmare they act like they're our necessity, rude ,ignorant doesn't respond back , reason I don't want to order thing online is mainly because of rude delivery agent , today I had exam from 9 to 12 and delivery guy ringup approximately at 11 when I was writing exam ,so after exam as soon as I saw missed called him back but he completely ignored me and didn't even receive my call atleast he should have inform me to pickup from centre ."
2022,1,"This is the worst app I've ever used. There's is no option for exchange, and i didn't even get my refund yet , it's been more than 10days. I don't know whether i will get it or not. I'm deleting this app as soon as i get my refund. Seriously H&M . I'm really disappointed."
2022,1,"Unable to complete the order. After payment is made, it is taking back to returning customer login page even thought account is logged in. At this point, amount is deducted but order will not be confirmed. Such a hassle to contact bank to reverse transaction because of this issue from h&m"
2022,5,My fam loves to shop from u
2022,5,Good app
2022,3,"once i install this app it was good and the product i received for the first time was good.But later on ... i ordered for the second time with a voucher of 25%discount i ordered my favourite one and later the apps was bugged ...i cannot process it...it said""An important service is temporarily unavailable and the app cannot function without it.Please try again later or change country"".I don't know what to do...even if i re-install the app i cannot open the app normally ...worst shopping app..."
2022,1,Не работают в больших странах
2022,1,I can't even sign up.
2022,1,Wastr
2022,1,Bug
2022,1,"Useless, they are looting people's money. I had purchased sunglasses and it's around 20 days i haven't received refund. They are deducting Rs 150 for shipping, they sent me defective piece of sunglasses. This company should leave India as they are clearly looting people by not refunding their money and even after sending faulty products still they are charging for shipping expenses. Please boycott them. Useless and looters"
2022,1,Worst app ever. Tried ordering. Money was taken but no orders were placed Had to wait 7 working days for the money to become reverted. So i tried again. Ordered few things on top as well. Guess what. They took the payment AND NO ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED. I used to like this store. Wth happened???!!!
2022,2,All my liked article are just gone...
2022,1,very disappointing tat hnm.is delaying to pay back my money from the item which i returned
2022,2,Terrible terrible app. Always error.
2022,1,"Makes hundreds of connection attempts to privacy-invasive trackers like Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Optimizely, even while in the background, that my network filter blocks. I have to force-stop this app after each use to stop these tracking connection attempts and the battery drain. Sometimes the app won't load content or save favorites. I hate this app. The website isn't much more reliable either."
2022,1,"WORST experience ever buying online with H&M. Have been trying to get a refund for 2 weeks already. First their system was down, then their customer service took a week to get back to me. Then they arranged pick up at a time their delivery partner does not support. 2nd time told me wrong info, 3rd time the pick up arrived on completely diff date. Had to constantly chase them for updates and fix their mistakes. No proactive communication. Returns process is troublesome with multiple forms."
2022,5,Good service
2022,5,exceptional variety
2022,2,There is a option to pay over klarna I have that when trying to activate its just spinning and not doing anything if you fix ile leave a positive feedback
2022,1,I hate the refund policy
2022,5,I love h&m app
2022,2,It is good but I'm upset I ve return a t shirt because it was too big for me n had been waiting for the refund but they haven't refunded me it has been more than a month now. It's upsetting.
2022,5,"It's good, minimal, worthy, with satisfaction"
2022,1,So this happened to me some days ago. I ordered a jeans for Rs. 1999 but when i received it the actual tag price was different .. It was Rs. 1499. I complained and asked them to refund but they didn't. Very disappointed with this app. Even my friends are facing the same problem.
2022,1,The h&m delivery services is a sham.. Been 5+ days and hardly any proper date of delivery .
2022,3,"It's been more than 15-17 day , product not delivered..!!"
2022,2,Take so much in refunding. Almost 2-3 months. Please be cautious. And APP doesn't show order page. Something is doubtful.
2022,4,Expensive
2022,1,So. Many. Bugs.
2022,1,"What a horrible app, nothing loads when I click a peice of clothing. Broken app from a famous clothing brand"
2022,5,Always a good experience
2022,1,It's supposed to be free postage for H&M members but at checkout still charging me $7.95 postage...why? Is there a code I need to put in?.. can anyone help?
2022,5,Nice
2022,3,Pretty good for a shopping app! Need to fix the payments part though.
2022,1,Horrible service. You cannot cancel order once placed. And takes eternity to deliver. And in the name of offer they will scam you. 👎
2022,1,"Could not checkout . I had try multiple times,amount got deducted everytime time and after sometimes it,s cancelled"
2022,5,Amezing app for clothes purchasing quality so good 👍😊
2022,5,"love shopping from H&M, the best quality of material are found at reasonable price ♥️.."
2022,4,Yummy stuff
2022,1,I paid for the items through card and my membership account shows i didnt order anything although money has been debited from my account.
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Lately I cant acces the app
2022,1,Not for India There is no option for choosing india

2022,4,Good quality n fashion
2022,1,"It's good for browsing, adding things to your cart and for tracking your order BUT when it comes to PURCHASING just use their website via web browser. Transactions here are finicky at best"
2022,5,It's amazing quality of products available there ... really happy to do shopping with this..!!❤️
2022,5,awesome
2022,1,not work how to suppost
2022,5,Best

2022,1,😬
2022,4,"These days it took so long to deliver like more than 2 weeks. Although I love the quality of the clothes, they are superb but the delay in delivery makes me tired to ordering."
2022,5,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
2022,1,"What is wrong with this app, I've been trying to install but it isnt wroking,its showing pending everytime i try...need help,anyone there?"
2022,1,"Pathetic.Buy at your own risk. Their online shopping experience is getting worser day by day. 1) Longer delivery time than what's mentioned (2-7 days). My order reached the destination few days back and yet they have not delivered it. Every time I contact them, I am being told that the order will be delivered that very day but no one shows up. They are just fooling customers. 2) Longer refund time. 3) At times they won't even refund correctly. You need to follow up with them a zillion times."
2022,1,Money got deducted and not getting refund
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Awesome
2022,1,The order is keeping so long in progress not dispatching in days'
2022,1,My card was deducted but the order was missing. Orders are empty. Pls give me back my money.
2022,1,It has the worst shipping took my product 20 days to ships😡😡😡
2022,1,cannot login
2022,5,I love H&M Good quality products in reasonable price.
2022,1,Worst refund policies.. Not even deserve any star
2022,1,Worst experience ever on any shopping app. They pretend to give offers and when you order the product.they refuse to deliver and said ...one of your order couldn't be delivered. 2-5 days delivery is misleading as it's been 8 days and my order has not dispatched yet.
2022,5,Favourite company
2022,5,I just love it ❤️
2022,5,Best.
2022,1,"Such a buggy app, have added things to my bag, constant clicking on checkout but it just doesn't move to the next step, and it's not the first time it's happening"
2022,1,"Worst app ever! After checking out my cart, it immediately subtracted money from my bank account. However, after checking my order status it says ""no purchases made"". I have yet to receive a response from their customer service, I hope they fix this problem ASAP."
2022,1,It keeps logging itself out and glitching during payment resulting in my payment going through but no order being placed. It was working perfectly fine before.
2022,5,Very good
2022,4,Like it....
2022,1,Forgot password email do not sends on the given email
2022,1,return system is so poor. you cannot directly contact them or an AI. i did cash on payment. but when i return they didnt ask for my acc no. just pick up and nothing else
2022,1,"To start with app is so not proper. When creating a new Account doesn't show notifications or acknowledgement that a Account is created. Reset password is not working. New account or already existing account both is not able to login, says username password wrong. Even the basic thing of the app is not working, not sure why they are giving discount, if we use the app at the store, but the app is not at all in usable condition"
2022,1,"Worst service ever in online shopping multiple times i tried but faced the same they are like faked in delivery once I complained through calls and emails they are changing the tracker status only on every single day to make us fool after almost month order will return to H&M Witout your permission, Simple the fail to deliver, My suggestion is if you want on-line shopping don't choose the H&M to waste your time & hurt your expectations."

2022,1,"""Error when adding to favourites"" ""Something went wrong, please check in and try again later"" Is the error message I've been receiving for more a week now everytime I try adding something to my favourites. This issue has made using this app a menace. There is no point to scroll and check out all that's available if it can't be ""saved"" / ""added to favourites"" for future purchases. I might as well never log on to the app. Please rectify this issue at the earliest."

2022,5,Nice
2022,1,"Awful experience, tried 3 times to place order, technical issues, money we're blocked 3 times and no order is placed, so now I have a big amount of money blocked, fix your problems, can't place order and you blocked money for nothing. I'm gonna delete it. For other customers, be careful the amount of your order, a huge amount can be blocked and you'll have to wait a lot, for no order...such a disappointment."
2022,1,"Why I can choose the language separately from the region.! This so stupid I can't use this app because when I choose sweden as my region, it will choose Swedish language from me automatically. I don't know Swedish and want English. There should be an option to choose English always despite the region. I am very disappointed"
2022,1,deleted all items out of my cart. Can't find them anymore bc after 2 seconds it all refreshes
2022,3,I love h&m. I would had given 5 stars but your refund policy is very bad. It's been more than 10 days I haven't received my refund. It takes too long to get your refund. So think before you return an item.
2022,5,Great collection but too slow delivery
2022,5,Nice collection

2022,1,"Worst experience ever. Won't recommend anyone to buy online from this app as they don't respond on late delivery neither through their contact number nor through email.

2022,1,Return Policy sucks worst service ever by H&M
2022,5,Very good.
2022,1,"You coustmer service is second class....your agent should learn some manner and atticates and also...instead of solving my problem she's only protecting her agents...and she also not waited there for my review and left the chatbox...after all of these, i totally realise how second class is your coustmer service is...you only pretence that your coustmer service is excellent !

2022,1,"H&M as a brand in India is becoming more unproffessional by the day. After placing the order on the website and making the payment. The orders was not dispatched even on the 5th day, when I reached out, I was told the order would be shipped shortly, however 2 days later i received a mail saying the order was cancelled specifying no reason. In order to avoid such inconveniences, I started ordering H&M products via Myntra, however they sent me the wrong size twice in spite of exchanging it."
2022,5,Vin
2022,1,Messed up app.
2022,5,Op
2022,1,"The things in my cart disappeared, there were some clothes that i really wanted"

2022,1,Smoked all my drugs
2022,5,"The app is good, just wanted to point out one edge case. Whenever I search for something that doesn't match with any of the categories the app crashes. Like when I search for ""Skort"". Don't know if it's just for me of for other users too..."
2022,1,App is not responding
2022,2,I have not received my refund..and customer support is not responding for the emails and calls ......why you guys make return and customer support sections ? If they are useless Please contact...
2022,5,"I absolutely love 💗 H&M clothing store, I buy clothes here all of the time because they have such cute adorable clothes mickey mouse shirts and also adorable pajamas that are Mickey and Minnie mouse I am a huge fan of Mickey and Minnie mouse and other Disney characters ever since I was a little girl I have love 💗 loved every single Disney character and I will always love 💗 Disney and all of the wonderful characters from Disney Disney rocks!! Highly recommend shopping here."
2022,1,"-Worst app -If you want to buy cloths then please go to shop. -Since last five days I can't open my account and see about refund status and my account details. -I got a message that refund will take 30 days. Other apps don't take that much time. -Customer care number provided in the app is not valid -After using Amazon, myntra, flipkart this app seems worst. -They need to invest some money on app building."
2022,5,I like this app... And product also good
2022,4,"easy to use, nothing special"
2022,5,Awesome fashion stuffs available.
2022,5,Outfits are reasonable
2022,5,Good
2022,5,"Clothing is excellent products, good pricing, inventory is ample. The service is the best. I shop there often. 🇨🇦👍🏻"
2022,1,World worst product sale by h&m. Never by any product from h&m. Cloth quality is very poor. They sale street product on the showroom with high price tag.
2022,1,"I travel around Europe and I was really used to enjoy conscious campaign. Because of the app, I gave away more than 4 bags without any voucer. The reason is because the app does not scan and accepts scans in different countries and I can not waste my time with setting my phone all the time. Very bad app and today, it was a frustrating WEB service. The normal service won t help much ."
2022,1,Very bad experience i ordered a dress on 9th April and the app is showing only delayed in delivery they are not showing actual date or expected date and i placed a order for indore and they are showing indore location but not delivering my dress very bad experience
2022,5,Very convenient
2022,5,Great collection
2022,5,Best shopping app and experience
2022,1,Doesn't work with Paypal. Places paypal authorisation on hold. No way to contact customer support within the app.

2022,1,This app is freezing my phone
2022,1,Livrarea produselor e execrabila.Stau 2 zile sa proceseze o comanda mică
2022,1,One of the worst and disastrous app and customer service. H&M is such a huge company with the cheapest services didn't expect that. It's so disappointing.
2022,4,Hm is good but werid
2022,1,"It was fine last month. But this month, I have been trying to place an order since the first week of April. The page which says ""we are processing your payment"" Keeps on loading but doesn't take any order. I contacted the customer service twice and they are as unhelpful as their app. Myntra and other Indian app work much better than this. Huge disappointment H and M."
2022,5,Always the best
2022,3,Very useful
2022,5,Very good product app
2022,1,Horrible experience..I am uninstalling right now..they unnecessarily cancel my order after 7 days..it is unacceptable..I am sure they sell that clothe even after my order was placed first 🤬🤬..that was a limited edition and I just lost after ordering it successfully 😡
2022,1,"Horrible Experience This was my first and last order from h&m app. Its been already a week but no parcel received. One of the item automatically gone from order and no refund received not even an email. Pathetic and worst customer service too. I thought being a reputed international brand, H&M would be good in terms of online and app orders but this is worst way beyond the words."
2022,5,H&M is love 😍😍😍
2022,4,Good collection of item
2022,4,Very nive products available but the return and refund policy is not good.....very slow indeed

2022,1,Delievery time is so bad 👎👎👎
2022,1,"Very low quality product, the products shown in the application are just opposite from what is in real, my white colour canvas sneaker just came and the quality of cloth used in the sneaker is third class cheap....and the return policy is pathetic its just for name .... I'm never going to order any of product from H&M."
2022,5,Love the fashion.. the app as well. If only we could get a dark mode for it..
2022,2,keeps saying that I've been getting vouchers in accordance with my points but I can't see or use a single voucher hence defeating the purpose of being a plus member
2022,5,👍
2022,4,My experience has good so far but the refund is really too late and my hm isn't working right now so I had to reinstall it which is very sad .
2022,5,Nice

2022,5,"Great products, Great Quality, Great experience."

2022,5,Best brand i like to wear for otd
2022,1,Very average fashion
2022,5,Noice
2022,3,Nice clothes but each cloth varies in size and its really hard to judge the size Request : Add reviews of verified customers Personalize size recommendation based on order history.
2022,5,Great stuff
2022,5,It's awesome
2022,1,"Such a bad experience with H&M app it logged out my account itself now I'm unable to login , I'm adding right password but still they said it's wrong.."
2022,4,"The app is great for me, honestly. But, one thing I'm not satisfied with is the payment methods. I don't have credit card, so debit and online banking are the only options I can choose to purchase something. So, please add the payment method as soon as you can. I want to buy that baseball jacket! 🥲😭"
2022,2,Not working
2022,2,Price showed UK money I uninstalled and again installed. Page is not available I think not available to india

2022,2,I can't delete the items once I added in my cart! Wth!
2022,5,Very good quality clothes
2022,1,Its not processing any orders and even customer care doesn't have the authority to process orders. Pathetic!
2022,5,My favourite shopping app! Never disappoints me with new trends and launches.
2022,5,Love the product quality at which cost u are providing but some products in India' are at higher price but overall experiance is good with HM....
2022,4,"Currently the app won't let me remove 3 items from my shopping bag or add them to my favorites. I'm fairly certain they are sold out because you can't find them when searching the app. I don't want to place an order with them in the bag because I don't want to be charged knowing they are out of stock, but I can't find on the app where I can log out and then log back in."
2022,1,Worst app they don't value the Customer
2022,5,Best quality of cloths worth it
2022,1,This app is the worst. It doesn't work and I have to uninstall and then again install the app everytime if i want to check anything.
2022,5,Online description of products are very easily provided and return purchase policy are best.
2022,5,Best app!
2022,1,Why there is no region for India where in India there are many H&M malls
2022,2,"I used to use their App before and it was working properly. However, now for some reason I am not able log into my account to proceed with my purchase. The button isn't responding at all."
2022,5,Best app
2022,5,"I'm loving it more and more, I love all the products of h&m, all the products are very reasonable and most importantly I see the quality, it's A Plus plus 😀. Also love the points system, encourages to buy all the more 😉 I'm so happy with this app and also noow the home delivery is available to my location so its the best. Ohh I love it, it's my fav brand 😍"

2022,2,"I would be nice to actually place an order..other than that, works just fine"
2022,1,"Worst app, we can't even login in this app 🤯"
2022,1,This app doesnt work. You cannot pay from this app.it reloads ..debits money from your account and still doesnt place your order..bad experience while purchasing..if a buyer comes to buy from app..it takes alot of time n money place order.. Interest becomes low.
2022,1,Not able to process my payment
2022,1,They're frauds.. they lie to you on your face regarding delivery dates and status.
2022,5,Fabulous
2022,5,Love this brand
2022,1,"So this is the worst app, I am unable to use my coupon cards and h&m is not able to even resolve my problem, do you guys even have a development and testing team? Do you guys even check the issues? I have reported it many many many times but still no solution provided to me, I am a plus member and look this is what happening with me, I have now total 5 coupons and unable to use none!!!"
2022,4,Haven't shopped at H&M enough.
2022,5,Awesome app💖
2022,2,"I mean it's definitely better than ASOS and Forever21 apps because it's cleaner, faster, and simpler. But it really should have a more steady algorithm to reduce the errors. There are so many error and freezes the app has, it's ridiculous. Especially in terms of in stock and filters."
2022,1,Heart/Like button is not working. Ugh.
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Love H&M 😍💕
2022,1,"I returned two products and got their confirmation mail too and they failed to refund my money on time . Contacted their customer service so many times yet no one resolved my issue. Now while trying to reach out their service , my call didn't connect. I want my money back as soon as possible. They are acting like some thief who is on a run. Contact me back soon."

2022,4,Need the app in English also for sweden..... finding it difficult to use otherwise.
2022,5,I love everything about this brand and its products and the website is as great too.
2022,1,"H&m is a good brand but the app and site doesn't offer you a good experience. I recieved wrong product and after requesting return got refund of only one product,still waiting for remaining refund."

2022,4,Good
2022,5,Best!!
2022,1,"After 17 CALLS and 5 CHATS, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. THE WORST CUSTOMER CARE! EVEN 1* is MORE. YOUR TEAM IS WORTHLESS! THEY ALL HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO LIE INCLUDING YOUR ESCALATION MANAGER WHOSE NAME IS NEHA! THEY ALL LIE AND MY REFUND IS STILL PENDING SINCE MARCH 6th."
2022,3,Why is delivery taking so long?? It has been at warehouse for more than a week now.
2022,3,"Please add exchange features in your app. This will make a lot more easier for customer who only have limited amount of money. Otherwise make refund faster. We can't wait for several days to get our refund. Once the return item is pick up from our end, you should refund us right away."
2022,5,Nice

2022,1,"This app suck,doesn't allow me to add my address keep saying Special characters not allowed... Huh? What do you mean that is my address"
2022,5,Love all the fashion

2022,5,Excellent💯👍👏
2022,5,My favorite store to buy work clothes.
2022,3,The app is very glitchy.. I can never get into it when when making a purchase!
2022,5,Great service!
2022,5,Everything was great
2022,5,Very professional and operable
2022,2,Hard to use. In store there is no signal

2022,5,I love h&m
2022,4,Great experience I love it 😍❣
2022,5,Its adoreable
2022,1,"For some reason, I lost all my saved items. Also, there are way too many trackers in this app. It constantly tracks me even when I don't use it."
2022,5,Liked
2022,5,Very professional and nice
2022,5,Best place to shop
2022,5,This app is always the best
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,"h and m is the best fashion store after zara, as zara is expensive , h and m has good collection and even has best price, loving it"
2022,5,Nice clothes and online service
2022,5,It's osm
2022,5,Good
2022,1,Very cheap clothes
2022,5,Developers fix glitches less than 2 days. Never see that before. Wanted to rate and review to appreciate that!!
2022,1,Refund policy is too slow it's been 20 days but I haven't received the refund. Money gets stuck here
2022,5,So amazing products 😻 i loved it
2022,1,One of the best clothing co. With one of the worse technical assistance & costumer service. It is heart breaking to write this when you are shopping from a long time. I wish someone will read this from h&m & redress my grievance.
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Very helpful.
2022,5,The trendiest shopping app
2022,1,"I was fool that I installed this app and spent around 3k ( I still like my order but it was a larger size) and then I found that there is no proper channel for returns,then I read the reviews here..after much thought I have decided to not return my order rather I wud gift it to someone coz for me it's worthless..but one things for sure that I have deleted this pathetic app for good and am never coming back ."
2022,1,"horrible , the system is not prepared lots of issues regarding payment with different banks , paypal, swap etc , wouldn't recommend it"
2022,3,No stocks on all stores around us. You need to put the store branch where the shirt is available then update it when it's out of stock. It really gives help for the avid fans of h&m. I hope you read my comment and take some actions about it
2022,5,Great
2022,1,Very poor order service. And no value for customer's time. Three months and still no refund and everytime the customer care service only gives fake assurances for immediate refund. Worst experience ever. Might as well buy through Myntra 😐
2022,5,Good
2022,1,I need help. How do I remove the items I don't want from the cart? I have been trying for a whole day now
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Very nice ji 👌👌🙏❤️😘😘
2022,5,Good
2022,2,"My shopping bag doesn't seem to sync with my online account. Even when it does, my shopping cart is empty the next time I open the app. Update: My past online order history also disappeared. I usually refer back to my past purchases for sizes."
2022,1,None of my online payments would go through!!! Even after trying multiple times.
2022,5,Best brand anyone can get
2022,1,"Such a disgusting brand ,such a scam they sended me a wrong item and try to contact the customer service they sound freaking confused"
2022,5,"We as 26ers need something plain and elegant. This is where H&M comes in. The app makes shopping seamless and have perhaps one of the best collections and price. Their Delivery coverage is also amazing, beats grocery shopping as well sometimes."
2022,5,"Customer service is excellent, love their collection. It has never disappointed me with its quality nor with its refund process."
2022,5,Amazing
2022,2,I have been trying to place an order but it just keeps saying that there's been an error.
2022,5,Nice clothes
2022,5,Awesome
2022,5,Best.
2022,5,Great platform
2022,1,It's the worst shoping app I've ever used it dosen't show my latest order and i can't even track it it arrives in a random day unknowly if i could track the order and know the day of its arriving i could manage the things from of i could be out of station o could far from my home some times ...it's so pathatic app worst experience so far.
2022,5,best
2022,1,Mera refund abhi tak wapas nhi aaya kya dikkat ho rahi hai it's very wrong aap kar kya raho ho customer service bhi kharab hai call karo toh switch bata raha mera refund mujhe wapas karo plz
2022,3,Mid
2022,4,It's great
2022,5,"This app use very good perfect. It is an app that gathers both shopping and fun, so it is well used."
2022,1,Won't even open. Uninstalled reinstalled clear cache ect. Restart phone. Everything. Nothing works to open it
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Great app for easier browsing on the phone, but for some reason it eats up 1% battery per minute even when not in use. This started happening as soon as I installed it and my phone gets hot too. It's not a coincidence, as I haven't installed any other app or changed anything on my phone. From 28 hours battery life, it dropped to 5-6 hours once I had this installed."
2022,5,Never failed to dazzle
2022,1,its not really a user friendly app. Especially when you are about make payments.
2022,2,I have been member of h&m for one year now and its was my favourite shoping apps.. i have reinstalled it and now I'm having trouble in signing in..it's shows technical issues so it's a red flag for me
2022,5,Amazing
2022,5,It is very good
2022,5,I had to download the hm app because your mobile site is so so bad. At least the app seems to work.
2022,1,Refund policy is worst mf takes 30 days to refund
2022,5,Love love H&M!
2022,1,The disgusting thing about the app being not able to login .. ffs I've been trying to login to my account for past 1 hr and it's showing me incorrect password whereas I've even logged out from laptop and logged in with the same password.. how shall I use the app if you don't allow me to login to my acc
2022,1,"Can't log in and when I press forgot password, it doesn't send any email"
2022,1,"This is really difficult as a non japanese. I can't even translate by coping the texts. I want to know what information they are asking for, for placing an order but I can't do so. Please add option where we can translate or at least copy so we know what we need to put."
2022,5,I'm always very fond Of H&M❣️
2022,5,Loved it.
2022,1,"Dont download this app Most useless app ever,I can't even view my order ,it's saying error 24/7"
2022,1,They didn't refund my money from 1 month
2022,5,Wow
2022,5,binod
2022,1,App had not been working properly lately. Hangs at the last purchase confirmation page. Annoying
2022,5,Great experience with the app ! Easy returns and refunds on time... Bring in the summer collection soon with more colour options !! Keep up the great work 😂😁
2022,1,Please fix ur app... I can't remove item from my cart and cannot refresh it
2022,1,"App is good, Rewards program does not work. Even after calling and emailing customer service I never received the points for my 6 orders when I had signed up. I have a member ID and account but for whatever reason its never reflected in the app. Feels like they just dont care other retailers dont have this issue."
2022,5,Best application for shopping
2022,1,"So disappointed i really loved the boots and order them but the order got cancel by itself and said it was cause i didnt tàke the call,,when the delivery man didnt even call.... Really disappointed... I hope could fix that"
2022,2,"I like shopping h and m but being in the stores gives me anxiety so I do it online, but if you leave stuff in your cart it just gets deleted. So after about an hour of online shopping I favorite all the stuff in my cart so it wouldn't disappear but it ended up only saving 2 things to favorites which really sucked because I finally found a couple pairs of pants that I really wanted to try out😐"
2022,5,Good products
2022,5,Awesome 😎👍
2022,1,Is not working
2022,4,The products are great. However the delivery is always delayed by days then the expected delivery date
2022,4,Best app for shopping. Collection Variety fitting etc are great. H&M comes with latest European fashion
2022,5,I Love This apps much better product ahead 😍✌️
2022,1,Terrible app. Terrible user experience.
2022,5,Good app easy to use fast checkout ability to save favorites. I do wish that favorites did not delete after a certain time though.
2022,1,"The absolute worst experience. I repeatedly had difficulty logging in once I registered as a member. On top of that unable to proceed to payment because asks me to select another ""delivery method"" when it's not even a selectable option. Seriously you're losing out on your business like this, what are the PMs and the developers doing...."
2022,3,"Adding to cart and liking the items need to be fixed. Other than that, it is all good."
2022,5,Really Useful
2022,5,My fav brand
2022,1,Can't edit items in cart.
2022,5,H&M really good for those who have a great fashion sense
2022,5,❤🔥
2022,5,Good shopping
2022,5,Amazing service best e commerce app ever
2022,1,"Vary stupid company because they closed there business in Russia 🇷🇺 as soon as President USA 🇺🇸 ordered them, but don't forget that if you think to back again to working in Russia no one off your clients will for you. H&M GO TO HEAL FOREVER. 👎👎👎"
2022,1,You should provide English language option for expats living in Norway
2022,5,Bestest experience 😇😇
2022,5,The best app for clothes
2022,5,👍
2022,2,I used to love this app so much but it's really bad now. I wanted to buy the dress which I added in my wishlist which was out of stock nearly two months ago. For the past 2months I have been checking it. It has not been restocked until this very moment. It's very hard to talk to the customer care also. What is wrong with this app ? I seriously don't get it. It's that hard to restock the dress or respond properly in your customer care? Notify me if this product restock doesn't even work i guess.
2022,4,It has many clothes and there so pretty!
2022,5,Awesome app
2022,1,Got good stuff in this app however it wouldn't be a good app if its telling me it has technical issues constantly when trying to purchase anything
2022,5,Best shopping app and h&m is the best gives you best quality clothes with affordable price and trendy clothes.. in love with h&m the only problem is the they rarely gives a discount..
2022,5,❤️
2022,5,Good!

2022,5,CP lee
2022,4,Return policy should be improved.
2022,5,Love it :D
2022,4,"Okay, but you can only add 60 items to your wishlist. What's the point in having a limit?"
2022,5,Not a 5 star is a fake app
2022,5,I bought one denim from h&m .. I love that evryone ask me whitch brand is this Fitting is awsome
2022,2,My app is not working
2022,5,Perfect than zara
2022,3,Delivery takes too long
2022,1,"They have the worst customer service possible, they are simply focused on taking your money and at the goodwill of customers"
2022,5,👍
2022,1,Does not work
2022,1,so bad they are not returning the amount once its recived on their Wearhouse they sre not refunded any single amount
2022,1,Worst delivery and return process. H&M gave me damaged and used product then won't even return it I had to call them 200 times.i say myntra is better than this app.Never gonna order again.
2022,5,👍
2022,1,"It's very bad when it comes to refund! I returned my product 20 days ago! I mailed them, call their coustomer service! No one replied! Will Never buy anything again! Very disappoint 🙏🏻 It's doesn't even deserve one Star! But for the posting my review i had to give one!"
2022,1,It's so frustrating! Im unable to update my cart. It keeps saying there is an error and i keep uninstalling just to make the items in my cart correct. Argh!!!!
2022,1,"Sucks 1- it doesn't recognised password 2- cannot remove items in the cart, keep show error 3- lousy system. Bye H&M"
2022,5,loved its products and fast delivery
2022,1,"so dissapointed, i try to order 1 item and the final purchase page keep on saying ""processing your purchase"", the page keep on loading forever so i backout and try again, and suddenly i have 2 items ordered without any confirmation/information from the app, and there's no cacellation option even when the product is still not shipped"
2022,5,Love the quality and easy online shopping
2022,1,All is bad
2022,5,Nice
2022,1,Why am I getting this app in some other language? I want the English language version only.
2022,1,I am going to file a fraud case if H&M is not going to refund my money.
2022,1,Deleted item in cart and auto added back again. I can't even make purchase due to this and funny enough it happened before as I was reading other reviews. No one seems to care to fix it!
2022,1,"If Joseph Campbell thought up a fashion brand driven by pure nostalgia, it would be called H&M"
2022,5,😘😘😘😘
2022,5,Best products in best price
2022,5,Love it
2022,5,Excellent service
2022,5,Facing app issues - states an important service is temporarily unavailable and the app cannot function without it
2022,5,Quality products one of my favourite brands
2022,4,I love H&M and the app! I wish items stayed in my cart longer then a day.
2022,5,Good quality clothing
2022,5,My shopping experience whenever i visit h&m is always soooooo Awesome customer service is fabulous
2022,5,Love it
2022,2,"The apps version is terrible. 1. Can't save Likes. Everytime i press the love button, it never save or appear in my wishlist. 2. Can't delete cart. When i add items in cart, they can't be removed. Everytime i click to remove, they dissappear and then a second later the page refresh and the items appear back 3. Items in apps are alittle late in appearing out of stock compared to website All in all, webpage website is easier to use than terrible apps experience 🤦🏻‍♀️"
2022,5,Love app
2022,2,COD please
2022,5,Favourite brand application
2022,5,Bestt shopping app !
2022,1,"App needs more work, there is no option for exchange and refund policy is very very SAD, my experience on H&M and was very annoying. Pls update your app and make it easier for customers. I even ordered for a set of 3 tshirts for my son and received a complete different product. Please improvise."
2022,1,I can't open my bag option .so how can i order something?
2022,1,"Worst delivery system. I ordered a tshirt on 20/02/2022 and today is 4th March but no sign of delivery yet. Your customer support is also worst even they are not able to identify what the problem is . If you don't want to deliver this t-shirt then pls deny the delivery , why do you want me keep waiting . Shouldn't have ordered from you."
2022,1,Poor service bad quality racist company
2022,1,Worst shopping experience ever...I ordered one running shoe and I got an unmatched shoe size...couldnt return it as I could not log in again in the same account.
2022,1,Worst return and refund policy. Quite disappointed to see their service like some low budget online shopping. I received the wrong item and I couldn't even return it. Been trying to return it for 4 days now and it keeps on saying label generation failed.
2022,1,One of most pathetic customer service i have ever had. They send me another shoe which i haven't ordered. And when i return now they are say it will take 14 days to get the refund. So shame on you being the big brand you guys should focus on customer service more. I did many shopping through other websites but they were all good. I didn't expect this from this brand. So disappointed.
2022,5,Love it!
2022,1,Sad such a Huge Brand and dont take order's from Nashik City.
2022,1,Pathetic management!!!! Very poor service.
2022,1,Refund not received
2022,5,Best app.
2022,1,It was worse . Really bad refund policy. It's almost been 2 months since I returned my products and didn't receive refund
2022,1,Worst shopping app ever seen.
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Nice
2022,5,"Trendy and good fabric.,👍"
2022,1,I'm so disappointed!!!! I order 2 weeks back and still not received my product
2022,1,"Didn't expect H&M app to be this bad,server always down and it's been more than 4 hours i trying to return a product but it keeps on saying label generation failed. Hired some new software engineers will ya H&M"
2022,5,just amazing....no words.. perfect fit
2022,5,Most comfortable & fashionable clothing.
2022,5,Awesome
2022,5,I love h&m
2022,5,I am fully satisfied about the quality of the products as well as about the services too.. But items are bit expensive.
2022,5,Trying to fix everything that they done messed up
2022,5,Bibhuti
2022,4,"I will love to shopping from H&M, because the quality it's awesome 😊"
2022,1,The worst customer service ever!!! Called 4-5 times and they would connect it but each of them didnt answer anything at all.Its like they muted the call

2022,5,Great!
2022,1,"awful app, poor experience, payments never work, and you get to pay delivery even for huge orders, particularly considering the products' prices."
2022,5,Good
2022,5,"Size inclusive, beautiful designs, well executed shopping environment, good deals and constant sales and fresh finds.. great cc lothing selections, and its all afordable and at your fingertips. Thanks for a much needed (and pleasant) shopping experience."
2022,5,Best
2022,5,Good looks
2022,5,Easy to use and secure
2022,1,doesnt open at all
2022,1,Unable to place any orders... useless app doesn't show any option to deliver via prepayment or cod ...bug needs to be escalated .Don't waste customer time.
2022,1,"They send wrong product, demaged product"
2022,1,One of the worst place to buy anything. I guess the packages are sealed by those guys who consume weed that's why they deliver wrong items. I personally suggest not to buy anything from this filthy place.
2022,1,"Pathetic refund policy, why does it take you months to refund orders we paid for on the spot?"
2022,5,"Great app, easy to use"
2022,5,Different styles
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Loved HNM trainers.
2022,1,"I have returned my order on 6-7 December, on jan 6th I got an email that my returned item has reached the warehouse n it was said that it may take another 30days to receive my refund, BUT!! Its 25th feb and i Haven't received my money back!! It truly disappointing that such a popular brand has such issues! Try to improve your service! I have reached out to the customer service too, called them almost thrice n they just keep telling me to WAIT !? How long should I be waiting? 1year?"
2022,5,Love!!
2022,4,"It would be really really useful if you could filter and just search for things that are in stock and available online. Of 6 things I chose, 5 were out of stock. If you can't buy, what's the point?"
2022,5,Good
2022,5,"Its really awesome and cool, iam a big fan of H&M ❤️... Thank you..."
2022,1,Very very worst online services i order Boots for baby boy they send me wrong size after the long time of waiting i got wrong size so I was upset on that time so I applied for refund then they are come to pickup the parcel after 2days then it's on the way for translation what I mean to say is don't ever buy online H&M product in online they waste your time and for refund they take 1month time for refund i still don't get back my refund money 😔😔😭😭😭
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Great!
2022,5,Too good
2022,1,"installed and uninstalled back.. multiple times. still the problems re occured. removed items, the items will added back to cart. hello developer, this problems has been for months already. can HM apps change developer, or hire someone who can solve this problem? or admin never read feedbacks here???"
2022,5,So user friendly n i can get soo many member benefits
2022,5,Very nice
2022,1,"I love the brand but I give 1 star for the app due to the effort needed to find a product category or a product. For instance, I cannot find a blouse that is prompted in a Facebook add. I looked in all 'blouse' categories. Guys, if your sales go down don't ask yourselves too much why. This is why, the products are basically hidden. And BTW, under 'Molton blouses' category you have all types of materials not only Molton. Such a bad way to do eCommerce..."
2022,1,Waste

2022,5,"I love H&M, the style, the price, the ease of returns, keep doing a great job"
2022,1,Worst customer service I have ever seen. After calling them thrice for the same issue I asked them to transfer my call to senior. They just simply put my call on hold for 5 minutes and then disconnected. What the hell. Worst customer service ever.
2022,4,Too but when I bought brown sweater it's was too big xl even when I'm freaking fat it was so big for me little upset with that but overall it good all of the hm cloth quality and I'm scared bout the pant 46 size 😅 wish it's not comes out like such big I just to wanted wear jeans like lose pants like pinterest style

2022,5,beautiful dress 👗
2022,5,Beautiful collection
2022,5,"I just loved the app, they give good discount also. The same article i checked out on Myntra and i was not getting any discount there but when i checked that on this app i got discount of 600 rupees."
2022,1,Pointless app It's just a web view. Tried to scan a coupon and the app just frozen.
2022,2,"The app keeps logging me out of my account and when i try to login, it says I've entered the wrong email and password. I have tried resetting my password 2 times but the problem still hasn't been fixed. I still cant login to the H&M app."
2022,1,"Never got my refund, should have just kept the order. Also its impossible to contact them."
2022,5,It's an user friendly app. Needs more guidance to customer to understand redemption amount and value of each point and can these points be considered on discounted products.
2022,5,Such a quality product
2022,5,Great choice
2022,5,I don't understand why are there so much fake hate comments on every app.......This is absolutely good for fashion......maybe the coments are fake or this people can't afford H&M.😒
2022,1,"Worst payment gateway ever, they are unable to accept any type of payment method..cod not in option as well"
2022,5,V good.
2022,1,I can't sign in even if I put my correct password and email.
2022,3,"Nutze die App gerne, aber sie könnte benutzerfreundlicher sein."
2022,5,Nice trendy collection

2022,5,I love h&m app! It is so easy to use! With just a few clicks you have ordered your favourite things to your house! I think it is one of the easiest online shopping apps to use! Love it!
2022,5,Best simply the best
2022,1,"The one thing you are supposed to maintain as a big brand is quality, but I guess even that is too much. No proper packaging, no finishing and do you not even provide cases for sunglasses? Would give you a 0.5"
2022,2,Too costly
2022,5,Gud
2022,5,Excellent
2022,5,Awesome
2022,5,Gimme more offers :)
2022,5,I had recently problem with request refund so jad to reinstall app but apart that all great!
2022,5,Value for Money
2022,1,Takes 2 months for refund to arrive
2022,1,"Unprofessional idiots sitting at the warehouse. Absolutely ridiculous service in back to back orders. Don't even bother replying to this as I've spoken to your customer care already. You guys just deceive customers with your sweet apologies but at the end result is still same. Please employ professionals to pack and address issues at the warehouse, not absolute dunderheads!"
2022,1,"Impossible to connect to your account, the items keep reappearing even after removing them from the cart."
2022,5,Good
2022,5,Cool
2022,5,Good shopping experience

2022,5,I love it for my darling daughter. Very comfortable 🙂
2022,5,La amo <3
2022,5,Good
2022,1,"Deserves a zero star honestly. Worst shopping experience ever. Pathetic return refund policy. Slowest customer care service. It's been more than a month now since I returned the product. But still they haven't even initiated the refund yet. Each time you contact their customer care service, they tell you to wait for n number of days. They'll register your complaint too for saying sake, but in reality they don't give a damn. Uninstalling it asap."
2022,5,Excellent!
2022,5,Thank you for trusting BGYO

2022,5,I love it.
2022,1,Worst Disaster their delivery partner takes 2 months to deliver order within India and that to back to the store claiming they are not getting address inspite of home located on main road . It's a biggest scam on app store don't buy online buy from store and Hs m customer care don't care for customer feedback time and again after telling them same thing .
2022,5,♡♡♡♡
2022,1,Pathetic service and worst refund policy I ordered a hoodie and got it delayed . I received it but as it was oversized i returned it . Their refund policy says ill get refund within 14 days which is already longer than usual . Then i ordered a hoodie again of smaller size but i recieved the wrong product and i have my earlier refund still remaining . Now i have 2 refunds remaining and ive lost around 5k . I contact to the customer service daily and they keep saying contact us in 24 and 2 days
2022,5,It is very good app
2022,1,I have been following up since long for the return pick up but no one has come and i receive messages daily that your return would be picked up today ...no response on mail also.
2022,3,return and refund service is tooo slow and exhausting.
2022,1,Never buy from this product their size small is same as large or xl. And it's been more than one month since I have returned my product but still no refund yet. This is a fraud company.
2022,5,😍
2022,1,"Worst experience I have filed a return on 12 Jan 22 , i still have not received my refund yet . Don't trust this app they are so irresponsible"
2022,1,"Have a horrible return policy they are not refunding the money back ,have been chasing them since a month . The customer service is very rude .they simply put your call on hold and and are not worried a penny and talk in a fake British accent as if they are so meticulous. Would never purchase again from the app"
2022,5,I am little bit disappointed because offers not available..... other wise good service and clothes
2022,5,Probably the best
2022,1,Worst app ....payment process is too slow so disappointed
2022,1,I give it 1 star only cz of its refund process now its been 38 days of return i haven't received any single penny.... So disappointed
2022,4,Good app
2022,5,Best shopping app..
2022,1,Worst shopping experience ever I have returned their item on 9 December but till now I didn't received my refund from them whenever I call them they used to give me an excuse like you will get your by 2 to 3 working days.
2022,5,It's legit.
2022,5,Best fashion product in h&m must try and very comfortable clothes. Yes this is the nicest app in play store.
2022,5,👍🏽
2022,5,I think the clothes are really good and cute 😍

2022,4,Quality products

2022,3,"App is good, no ads, good clothing, etc. I'm rating it a 3 because I ordered 2 shirts about 4 months ago that hasn't ever came and won't ever come, I confirmed my package and everything got nothing. I tried checking in purchases and other stuff but no, nothing works. I just left it like that, there's nothing else to do"
2022,5,Best shopping app
2022,5,Clothes are fabulous for kids!!
2022,5,Good and affordable app
2022,3,Id prefer the actual store anytime but then i thought to order online once. I made my order on 27/12/2021 and i was promised that it would deliver in a week but it didn't arrive and when i contacted the customer service they said that the order left to delhi from where the order was placed(and i wasnt informed until i took the action)so i had to cancel the order after a month i received a call saying that the order has came to the place where i live. But still am giving 3 stars cuz of the dress
2022,1,Selling duplicate items
2022,5,Verey helpfull
2022,2,Return policy is not satisfied. No tracking for returns
2022,5,So good app and nice so cheap
2022,5,"Great service, quick delivery. Authentic stuff and easy returns"
2022,1,"God forbid you return a product for a mere size issue. They will never refund, customer service is absolutely pathetic. If only I could attach my call logs and recordings. The agony they have caused me. They say refund wil be inititated within 14 days when reality it's just a big scam. You need to spend hours with them on customer service forgetting about any work you have and escalate the issue. Even then absolutely no resolution. I am definitely going to file a consumer complaint against them"
2022,5,Wow The products are of good quality 😍
2022,5,"I absolutely love H&M,On time delivery always..never faced any issues."
2022,4,Delivery process could have been faster
2022,5,"Nice, waiting for clothes rn :p"

2022,1,I tried using H&M to get authentic products directly from them i ordered a combo from which i only got one piece and i request a return then its been a month the product is with them and my amount ia also with them. This ia the worst services ce refundable service you can get . I gues they can do a lot worst than that THANK YOU H&M
2022,5,This is my go to brand... Just love love love it

2022,5,👍
2022,1,I ordered and they cancelled my order
2022,5,Good quality
2022,5,Love it!!
2022,5,Great
2022,2,Delivering wrong products and not refunding the money is not something I expected out of H&M. Seems they have started to take the Indian customers for granted.
2022,5,It's super easy to find the stuff you need <3
2022,5,Buenísimas promociones. Amo comprar en su app
2022,5,Amazing collection and top notch quality of all the products
2022,4,"I love H&M as a brand, but their return policy is beyond horrifying. In Romania, the company that deals with returns (Econt Express) has the worst customer service ever! I tried for 3 days straight and hours on hold to get to them for a return, but only when I called H&M customer service was I able to do that (I had to call at closing time - 8 PM- because they also kept me on hold for hours). So, yea, great clothes and sales but AWFUL customer service at usual hours and return courier company."
2022,1,"Worst experience ever, It's been a month since I returned my parcel and still no refund."
2022,5,Love BTS
2022,1,Products get deleted from favorites automatically and that too again and again.
2022,5,Best shopping app I highly recommend you this amazing app
2022,1,"The app has issues. I forgot my password, and when I try to send an email to change password, I don't even get that."
2022,3,Payment issue ..
2022,1,H&M is good but return policy is worst
2022,5,"Başarılı, tavsiye ederim"
2022,5,It’s amazing! Beautifuly made affordable clothes.. stylish fashionable and tailored…......
2022,5,Very good app to buy shoes and clothes
2022,1,Worst Exprerience with this app. Suffered log in issues can't able to place order so irritating now didn't want h and m clothes anymore 🙏
2022,5,Good App
2022,5,Beautiful and for right size as well
2022,5,Love it !
2022,5,Customer service is better than Zara and other online shops. I never had a bad experience with them. The UI interface is far better than Zara and doesn't close on you automatically. Easier to reach out via phone or chat.
2022,4,I like the fashion
2022,4,👍👍
2022,5,Easy to use. Love this app
2022,1,"Pathetic customer service. Don't order from here. If you want h&m, might as well order from Myntra or other sites. Hated it. More than 2 weeks l am waiting for a return pickup"
2022,5,Besttt app everrrr
2022,1,I can't go back as it is asking me to provide 5 Star Rating..
2022,5,Very good app for shopping very useful high quality products
2022,1,Has login issues. I have tried to reset password. Still showing as wrong password even I entered it correctly.
2022,4,Need more discount
2022,5,"Enjoy shopping online with this app, not hard at all and actually too easy."
2022,5,Ok
2022,4,Absolutely love em
2022,1,"Not even compatible with my smart phone. I have been a customer of h&m for years and for the app to suddenly stop working and the update not be compatible with my phone, meaning I can no longer collect vouchers or points in store makes me incredibly frustrated and question whether to continue shopping with you. This needs to be looked at."
2022,1,"Выбрасывает из учётки и больше не принимает пароль, даже после его смены. Попробовал на двух новых учетках. Представляете каково перед кассой это обнаружить?"
2022,5,Excellent
2022,5,A very well place to order
2022,4,Good quality product 👌
2022,4,It's good to work with it
2022,5,Amazing
2022,5,Insane
2022,2,"I can never log on. It tells me that my password and username is wrong, and when I request a new password, I never get the link. I can log in on desktop but never on the app.. kind of pointless to have the points program now"
2022,5,Lovar
2022,5,Luv u h and m
2022,5,Good ❤️
2022,1,I can't sign in and they won't recognize my password even tho i already reset it.

2022,5,Why not Thailand Pls include Thailand in app
2022,5,Unbeatable prices with much much options
2022,1,they love fashion alright. Racist fashion
2022,5,Excellent
2022,1,Worst experience. The payment is cut from your account without confirming your order
2022,5,Shopping from H&M has always been quite satisfying and pleasurable. So far I've had a smooth purchasing experience.
2022,5,"It is the best shopping app! The cost is not too much, the price is worth the quality of the cloth! U will extremely love it! Install it right now, and start ordering!"
2022,3,"Everytime i wishlist products,after some days wishlist becomes empty saying ' you have no favourite yet '.whats wrong with this app?"
2022,5,Excellent products at very reasonable price. App is extremely user friendly.
2022,5,🧸🧸
2022,1,"You will get variety, not size. Not recommended for slim fit men."
2022,4,Y dont u have the option to check in store availability like zara?
2022,5,Love it!!
2022,1,I have returned my product And delivery man picked my product But still i didn't get my refund and in an application didn't shown my product return status

2022,1,The refund process is so bad. It's been more than 14 days and I haven't received my refund yet. This is not acceptable from such a reputed brand.
2022,1,"Constant issues with H&M, their orders and delivery services."
2022,5,Unbeatable quality and delightful designs for kids and toddlers.
2022,1,Not able to place an order don't no why...
2022,5,It's easy to shop during the pandemic. Great collection great offers.
2022,4,I don't know why I am getting a one star but it's fun
2022,5,Never disappoints 💘
2022,5,I love h&m.. But only one thing h&m should improve that is refund process
2022,1,Worst ever company experienced 0 customer service Takes about 50 to 60 days for refunds of the returned product. Very bad should be banned in india. #banhandm
2022,5,Love it ....
2022,5,Best brand

2022,5,Good
2022,1,Return option is too complicated. Customer service sucks as well.
2022,2,Products are good but worse customer service. Takes too much time to refund your money and you can't even cancel orders.
2022,5,B eyond satisfaction!
2022,1,Really bad experience.I ordered for the first time through this app and got wrong sized shoes delivered.Placed a return request and it was picked up the next day.It took 6 days to reach the warehouse and even after it reached they didn't give me my refund.The customer service agent said the same thing every day that you'll receive your refund within the next 24hours nothing was credited on my account.They promised me a callback from the supervisor which also didn't happen.Not recommended at all
2022,2,It's almost impossible to get the clothes you want because everything sells out in 5 minutes. Whenever I want to use the Notify Me button it doesn't work either. I would really love to see an improvement on inventory and website and app functionality. Very disappointed.
2022,2,Very very slow process for make payment ==
2022,1,Worst service regarding the refund.
2022,5,Good
2022,5,❤❤
2022,5,Nice

2022,1,Delivery not available
2022,5,Great offers !
2022,5,Best 👌
2022,4,"The app is good and have no issues. The only problem is with the payment. They take so long to confirm the payment. And even after the payment and receiving messages that money is cut from my account, and i later get a mail stating that my order has been cancelled because of the payment. Odered something today again, and my payment was done, till now its showing payment is pending. Disappointed. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star."
2022,5,Nice app
2022,4,"Está cool, pero le faltan funciones, para saber mejor tus tallas y recomendaciones."
2022,5,Happy shopping

2022,1,Horrible experience with their customer service. Have been waiting for 30 days and still haven't received my refund. And today when I again tried to contact they are still saying they need 7 days to check the issue when they sent me the wrong size in the order. Horrible experience wish could give them 0 rating.
2022,5,I love H&M

2022,1,"If you return an item, they'll refund you only 60% of the amount, and not the flat 150 Rs delivery charge they take."
2022,1,Pathetic... I don't know how come brands play around with emotion of customers. It's been so many days I am taking follow up on my refunds but there is no supprt
2022,5,I love it 😍😍😍

2022,5,Yeah it's good

2022,5,"La app Trabaja rápido, actualiza su inventario constantemente, tiene promos exclusivas, y para mi ritmo de vida hace las compras súper cómodas, las pruebo en casa y puedo regresar modelos que no me quedaron dado a que tienen una excelente política de devolución, aparte que como cualquier otra tienda en línea puedes encontrar modelos en tallas que talvez no estén en una sucursal cercana."

2022,1,This app is good no doubt but when it comes to refund back the money they are not giving me my refund since last month they like after 30 days and 30 days are today over and I still didn't received my refund. I have tried to get in contact with them on Instagram but no help. Please help me out.
2022,5,Fast delivery and the amazing quality
2022,5,Easy to purchase app
2022,5,My favourite brand
2022,5,Best
2022,5,"Fantastic ,I'm in love with h&m"
2022,1,H&M Mumbai India = the worst online experience ever. They random cancel orders and then blame it on the courier company ( Amazon and flipkart and myntra also use that courier company and I've never had a problem with those 3) + HM bill for items which have not been shipped. H&M needs to work on their online sales fulfillment center. Have cried 3 times since 2020 to now 2022 while dealing with them. Once Covid is gone.. I am never gonna deal with H&M ever again.
2022,5,Good
2022,3,Best for shoping
2022,1,"Poor customer support, I was order a shirt nd it's too big in size I m trying to return this product but only msg is received for pick up but no one is coming to pick up the order. Plz do something in this regard, otherwise it's totally worst experience for me."
2022,5,Good quality stuff
2022,4,Good
2022,5,The clothes are amazing. No complaints. I personally love h&m :)
2022,1,Worst experience....Refunds take a life time to reflect ...customer services are poor to no end
2022,5,Good i love it's ❤

2022,5,Love
2022,1,"Such a fraud business you're doing. Fooling the customers in the name of brand. I had ordered two products and received wrong size. Now when I want to return the product, I'm unable to do it and called the customer service like literally 7 times and had to explain each one about the issue. It's really frustrating and time wasting. Expected it to be a good service knowing about the brand but I've been fooled and cheated in the name of brand.first time I ordered from this website and its terrible"
2022,5,"Always good to purchase online and in-store , excellent service ,good quality products ."
2022,1,"I have so much money stuck with them because their refund systems are age old and archaic. Atleast 8 items who's refund has either been forgotten to be processed, or been processed and stuck in the banking system even after the customary 14 days waiting period. Terrible for an international company to have third world systems."
2022,4,Please introduce exchange as well
2022,5,Best app for shopping
2022,5,Overall good experience
2022,5,"Super fine app. Everything looks Really great. it's very easy to use, and all it's content are very well organized and visually appealing. From browsing, to adding things to favorites, to adding cards and addresses and to purchasing... It's all smooth and fast."
2022,1,"I do not recommend purchases through the application. If the product / size is not good, the return can only be made by courier (does not accept the return of products to an H&M store). I made a return by courier (Econt Curier), which was delivered to H&M on December 29, and on January 11 I did not receive the money back."
2022,4,Good app
2022,5,Super😍

Its been 1 months since my money is been debited ...but they are just giving poor response and asking for more time ... In the mean time they even stopped picking up my calls when i asked them to transfer my call to their senior .... Worst app I've ever used , poor customer service . Today is 10th i still don't receive my refund yet. Worst app ! For me"
2022,5,Amazing.

2022,1,"H&M is a big name in fashion industry but the way they are operating online business is just worst. After returning any item, they take more than a month to refund the amount. Other small companies refund the amount on the same day of returning the goods or max by 3 working days,but here H&M is taking almost 40-50 days to process the same. Will never ever buy anything from their online platform now."
2022,5,👍
2022,1,"After filtering searches the app ""freezes stating fashion is fast..... """

2022,3,Very good app
2022,2,"When I first opened the app after installation and clicked on the search button, it kicked me off the app. I tried to reopen it but it would not work, even after closing all the mobile tabs. I recommend sticking to the H&M website to shop online, especially because of all the bugs other reviewers are reporting."
2022,4,Good
2022,5,"I Love H&M, 💓⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2022,4,I would have given it 5 star if they had exchange policy.
2022,1,Awesome
2022,1,to many issues with the app. im not disabling smartlock just to make one app work.
2022,5,Submit
2022,1,Your apps is down. Until now I can't access even reset password
2022,1,This app does not work in India.

2022,5,Good meterial
2022,5,I like it 🙂
2022,1,Stop enslaving people in Asia.
2022,1,Pathetic and unscrupulous return and refund process. H & M auto cancels your order sometimes and sometimes they send completely wrong product.You lose your bonus points because they do not return that even if the mistake is theirs!!! And the refund policy is so non transparent!!! No mail is sent confirming refunds!! Customer care comprises a bunch of nincompoops who have no clue about anything!!!! Very very bad experiences
2022,5,Great Products
2022,5,My experience with h&m is very good and the product quality is very good
2022,1,To be honestly worst app I return item a due wrong size they didn't not pickup till it as been 15days
2022,5,Jus love the quality of products and the ease of using app... ty HnM
2022,5,Hatika
2022,5,"I can't do without this app , my favourite live for my h&m app x"
2022,3,Too slow... When you add item in bag it don't show until you close the app and relaunch... Delivery is too slow. Items are good... Just have issue with app performance.
2022,5,Amazing patterns and good fitting
2022,5,Awesome
2022,4,Membership offers are not applied automatically
2022,5,Clothes are same as shown and the delivery is also good. I am personally wearing the clothes and it is very comfortable and looking good.
2022,5,"Easy to use app. High quality products, reasonably priced."
2022,1,"Really bad!!! Dirty, wrinkled package!! I'll NEVER use or buy this brand again."
2022,2,Doesn't work well with my ad blocker. Because of the number of calls your app makes to trackers and snooping systems ( which are blocked using pi-hole ) - A number of things in your app simply don't work (such as looking at past orders). Your app in the only one that fails in this way. Shame. I'll use Asos etc. in the future.
2022,5,"Siempre llega a tiempo, recibo exacto lo que pido y la ropa es muy linda. Buena relación calidad precio."

2022,5,Nice products
2022,1,Login using email password fails everytime on mobile app. Better use their website
2022,5,Best
2022,3,I gave it 3 stars because their delivery time is very much and they don't tell us that the product would come to you on the date they just told that 2-7 estimated delivery time and i am waiting for my product for so long....
2022,1,It doesn't even show me the delivery and payments option.

2022,1,"I had a very bad experience which I did not expect from h&m. I ordered something during the black friday sale which not only got delayed and then cancelled on it's own, but also I was not given a fair compensation for the same. Regret placing an order online. Should've bought it from the store offline."
2022,5,Good

2022,5,"Quick, reliable and quality buys!"
2022,5,Super easy to use
2022,5,The best!
2022,1,Can even give 0 stars.. their return policy is pathetic... They keep your money for a month or so and it is very difficult to get refund from them... I had a Very painful shopping experience with h&m... Even deliver wrong items which they cannot pickup...
2022,5,Great
2022,5,Perfect
2022,5,Me like it long time.
2022,5,Great 👌
2022,5,App is great and the quality of H&M clothes is superb.
2022,1,Return item is not working
2022,1,Worst online shopping app. It's almost a month. My refund is not yet issue. Everytime they are asking me to wait for 24 to 48 hours. Worst experience on first order itself
2022,1,"Worst shopping experience ever.....they charge money from you, cancel the order and then deny that the money was not received.....earning through cheating the customers.....fraud company I have mailed them all the required banking details reflecting the debit....and received a revert that the case is closed....no proper response....tgey are afraid of giving anything in written as they are fraudsters.......never trust them or u will end up losing your money"
2022,5,Best shopping app i would say
2022,5,I love this app! Is very easy to use 🤍🤍
2022,5,Gg
2022,1,Payment Gateway is a nightmare and somehow the company is least concerned with it. Have tried to order the same thing since 3 days but every time the payment fails and it asks for waiting 24hrs. Need to learn for other ECOM apps used in India like Myntra or Amazon on how to have a payment gateway
2022,3,The loyalty program sucks
2022,1,Unfortunately it only support one language for the Netherlanders and it makes it useless. Specially because you can't use Google translate inside the app
2021,5,Nice
2021,5,Good
2021,1,I order jogger but i received very horrible hoodie that is double XL and customer service is way poor than review you guys don't order anything from this app and install this app. My sister also order something from here she also didn't get item as per her order n when she return her percel they take back their item but she didn't get back her money so you guys think million times before order n this worse app i ever used.

2021,1,worst service I had purchased a jacket from h&m a month ago and paid through UPI. The amount got deducted but they cancelled my order for no reason. It has been more than a month and I have not been refunded. I have contacted customer service at many times but they are pathetic. haan it been any other any they would have resolved my query by now but h&m did nothing. The jacket was worth 3000 rupees and it has been more than a month but they are doing nothing about it. This is pathetic. Worst.
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Too much miss proper working ! Doesnt show if the order is been done or confirmed or even the payment is made or no !
2021,5,Very good collection

2021,1,H&m app scam explained: first they send you a faulty product so you have to request a return. After the product reaches the warehouse and you ask for the refund they tell you that you've already been credited when in fact you haven't received a single penny. When you callback to inquire more they block your number. I hope whoever reads my review doesn't have to go through the harassment of asking for your own hard earned money to a scammer over and over again until they cut you off completely.
2021,5,Best shopping experience love to shop with H&M please make exchange on online shopping
2021,1,How i can make purchase if your apps still under maintenance since yesterday?? Today is last sale. I very upset with your apps.. Cannot buy at all.

2021,5,Awesome experience
2021,2,The app is not updated properly. Many times when you try to add a certain it can't be added. Also the out of stock items are displayed.
2021,1,"Please fix your apps. I can't log in, can't apply voucher, can't remove items from my cart, can't check out. Already uninstall the apps but still not working."
2021,5,Well

2021,1,I have ordered particular product and I recieved the wrong size ...Further I returned it within a same day only and also updated my bank details for refund....Its been a month I still didn't recieved any refund or any message...Called up 10 times at customer care ...issue not resolved from their side This was the last time I ordered from this app...worthless app
2021,5,bit expensive.
2021,5,The cuality of the clothes is very good and the courier really fast.
2021,1,"One of the worst app I'm unable to reset my password. When I try to reset the password it does not send any link to my email address and every time I contact the customer service I get only one response ""the servers are down"" I was not able to claim my coupon worth 3000 because of your app..🤬"
2021,5,Loved the collection 😊
2021,1,The worst service ever. I am deleting this app it almost took 30 days to get my refund back. Worst brand i have ever used
2021,5,Awesome
2021,1,There is a lot of difference between the prices of the products sold in india than any other foreign countries. That's why I don't like their service. They just need more money from Indian's...
2021,5,Wonderful experience
2021,1,"The address keeps disappearing as soon as I write for 2 days continously and I couldn't order my stuff which at the end became out of stock. Got in contact with the customer care and I hear the same old uninstall pls, clear cache pls.. sign in from the chrome pls. Well, guess what ..it. doesn't. work!! I say it's better to order from Z yes a little expensive but hey they don't waste your time in hopes of giving you an offer!! Ciao I am done"
2021,5,Quality product but not long lasting if you are daily user
2021,1,"App is full of bugs. I was just browsing and about to purchase an item when app started showing ""an important service is temporarily unavailable"" and my app isn't working anymore. It's so ridiculous & frustrating. Fix the app!!"
2021,1,No improvement. keep getting worst. 1) item were remove but it bounce back to the cart..system error 2) cannot read the correct password. 3) cannot even go to check out.
2021,4,The quality is very Good but there is one issue. The size are very different. Sometimes its too big n sometimes small

2021,5,Lovely
2021,3,Refund is very very very slow . I refund my item 30 day earlier and I haven't get my refund even after 30 days . So please do something
2021,2,I love h&m however it's constantly logging me out of my account and then when I go to log back in it says wrong password or email even though it's correct. So I have to keep making new accounts every time I re open the app.

2021,5,Good
2021,5,Love H&M and app is so user friendly makes my shopping so easy!
2021,5,This app is very yous ful for me and my family
2021,3,I'm currently living in germany but only speaks English... is it possible to select germany as a region and English as a language??
2021,5,"top app, werkt snel"
2021,1,Links to H&M related stuffs got relayed to the web instead of this app. What's the point for an app then?
2021,5,Love online shopping at C&A
2021,1,"I ordered a jacket and a tank top, and recieved two tank tops, the customer service is saying, they can't do anything about it, we will have to return it. No exchange policy wow, they made the mistake and we have to suffer, i really didn't expect this from such a famous brand, now I have to wait for refund, I ordered this stuff for my bday and my money is stuck seriously very unhappy and unsatisfied. I'm getting scolded by my mom and really this is the gift hm gives me on my bday."
2021,5,Like that app
2021,5,Love HM
2021,1,"Very very very bad delivery system. No proper communication with customer for delivery, the delivery guys will cancel order depending upon their mood(and they will report no one was at home. Please h&m do something...(or change ur delivery system)"
2021,1,Worst service ever in return system. Trust me this was my first snd last order from H&M. It's been 10 days and no one coming to pickup the order. I'm calling them to pick up but they say we would but don't come. Please help ke to get the item back. I'm tired of this.
2021,4,Love the aap
2021,5,always good quality and on time delivery
2021,1,Bad! Avoid Shopping from this app. Return Process is very Slow. Extremely Slow n poor. If u like h&M buy it from Myntra.
2021,1,"Making the app mandatory for refunds and replacements of clothes (in India, as per the store clerk) is not cool. These are hygiene customer service offerings. And if it's for an e-bill, a website should be an option. I shop once every few months. You can't expect me to keep an app installed on my phone just for this."
2021,4,Make your app more user friendly
2021,5,Nice product
2021,5,They have a really great customer loyalty program where you don't have to spend outlandish amounts of money to earn rewards. Also really great selection and some cool features like a reselling program.
2021,1,"I have placed an order on 7th Nov payment got deducted but the order got cancelled from h&m app itself calling to customer care services since then but still no refund got till yet not even any confirmation from there end, I am soo pissed at it, never thought a reputed company will do this, earlier I was very happy with the service but never gonna buy anything from h&m ever again soo disappointed as a customer , this is just not done, worst customer service, worst app ,"
2021,1,"Never works in the shop. Have to wait for ages to open website and when it doest, jumps updates..."
2021,4,Allow users add the H&M membership into Google Pay/Wallet
2021,5,Very nice product
2021,5,Costly

2021,2,"There is a need to update the app, but it was not push to user. I wanted to try delete and reinstall the app, and noticed the update button is green in app store. It will be more meaningful to prompt user to update the app then keep it silent. After update, the app still didn't work. Most likely the party who performed the UAT tested the web version, but not the app version. I finally can access and edit my shopping cart using the web (after deleting the app)."
2021,1,Return policy and refund takes lot of time
2021,5,Favourite go to basics brand
2021,5,Excellent collection and service
2021,5,Best app for clothing Items if you have classy choice then go for it the quality of product is very amazing and the one issue is that the delivery is very slow but anyways all over my experience is very good 😄❤🤝
2021,2,It's been two months already since I returned two of my product. They refunded for one of the product but for the other they didn't refund still. I tried contacting the customer care but they're reluctant as they say refund have been issued already. Beware !!!
2021,5,I enjoy this app way more than i expected !
2021,1,Very bad shopping experience. Would not recommend anyone to shop from h&m. Zara is great.
2021,1,"Should've add Paypal, Gcash and Cash on Delivery for the Philippines. The payment options sucks"
2021,5,Good app!
2021,5,Very nice user experience!
2021,5,"It's really easy to use, love it"
2021,1,"Faulty payment gateways, poor customer support. I tried to purchase an item and paid via UPI. Although, my payment was deducted but the order was not confirmed. And it has been more than 10 days since i have not recieved any refund. The customer support is also telling me to wait for a week and now i have been mailed to wait for a month. Not expected from such a high end brand."
2021,2,"Works better than the site, that's not saying much. Improve the search functionality por favor."
2021,5,Best
2021,1,"Really very bad experience at H&M first time when I ordered a hoodie they deliver me a t shirt and kept the refundable money for more than a month, and second time when I purchased a jacket and I issued a return of the Same jacket for some reason the didn't send the delivery amount along with the products price. While other companies return the money along with the delivery money. Really very disappointed with H&M. Never going to purchase anything from them again."
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Goood can ve bettet
2021,5,Very good 👍
2021,5,Super
2021,1,I have always loved this brand so much ...and I have bought so many things ...but this time they sent me product from mast and harbours..I mean what a way of making fool . Shame on you . Such bigg brand and does such things .
2021,3,UK slag dogged is a great place
2021,1,Worst customer service. Waiting for refund from 15 days now I had called customer care 3 times already. I wish i had checked these ratings before. Never buying online ever again.
2021,5,Easy to use .
2021,1,You can't cancel your order
2021,5,App muy amigable
2021,1,Worst service
2021,2,"I have tried to login multiple times and it is the right email/password ,still unable to log in. Also the error sign keeps appearing when I try to remove item from cart. Besides that, it is easy to navigate products & great categories. 😊 Hopefully they fix the login & cart issue. Till then I'll just order off the site."
2021,1,"Really bad/frustrating app; to log on. It seems like H&M dont really want to trade,strange they want to turn away paying customers? I will be spending my money with other retailers."
2021,5,Det er bare bare så fint
2021,4,Awesome
2021,5,Good
2021,1,Can't login bad service
2021,5,Good however make the products more affordable

2021,1,Wortsr app i have use in my life delivery is so poor you have to wait a month for your refund
2021,1,"Pathetic experience, they are not able to process a refund since 1 month .Poor customer service"
2021,1,"Delivery service takes too long. I'm not gonna use this app for online purchases, very unreliable."
2021,1,"The return and refund policy is so slow. It take maximum 14 days to reach the warehouse, and after reaching the warehouse they will take more 4-6 days to process the refund. I haven't received my refund which I had returned on 1st December. Worst service!"
2021,1,Ordered an hoodie but delivery personnel behaved unprofessional and returned it without my consent. Tried to reach helpline but couldn't. I want the order at any cost. Please reach me if you can.
2021,2,"What is wrong with this app, since update I am not at all able to order anything it's always showing that there is an error and to try later."
2021,5,A good working app that makes it easy to find what I need and spend my money!
2021,2,Today I wanted to add some items since morning it's showing this product could not be added right now. This is not expected from H and M
2021,2,"I feel a moral obligation to no longer use H&M. I can't support fast fashion and cheaply made clothing items made in China. I think in the interest of the environment and taking power away from China, the world is best off moving their business elsewhere, to (more expensive) sustainability made clothes manufactured in less dictatorial countries"
2021,1,Don't waste your time buying here worst delivery 😰😰
2021,1,"Please fix your refunding process,, why the hell it takes a lots of days,, while others refund within 3days"
2021,1,"The costumer call service is worse, they do not care about customer's needs and requirements. Moreover, they played a fake reply for call, as if they are unable to listen which is total deceiving of customer and this activity should be corrected. I urge H&M group to please maintain this gap of miscommunication."
2021,3,User experience on the mobile app is not great.
2021,1,It's been 5 days where is my refund money??? fraud hai h&m
2021,5,👍
2021,5,Excellent
2021,5,"Other than the no ""out of stock issues"" I like the app. It's simple & user friendly"
2021,3,First of all I like the quality of clothes very much but sometimes delivery is delayed and also returned even without informing. Also the customer service is not of any help. Furthermore I had a lot of conscious points but when I uninstalled and reinstalled it my points became zero. I'm so fed up with it..
2021,1,Why this apk. take to much delivery charge. Please i request to reduse your delivery charge.🥺🙏🙏🙏
2021,5,Verynice
2021,5,Best clothes
2021,5,Lovee this appp💕💕
2021,5,"Me encanta, solo el tema de devolución de artículos es complicada, ojalá se pudiera en tienda fisica"
2021,5,It's cool
2021,4,Gud
2021,5,Really useful easy to use app
2021,3,"I want to cancel one of my orders , but I can't find any cancel button in that section.kindly add cancel option for orders.🙂😐"
2021,5,Siempre fácil de usar y con promociones
2021,1,Since last update I can only access my member ID and vouchers with a thumb print scan. That doesn't work on my phone and there is no other way to unlock them. Very annoying!
2021,5,I love shopping on line
2021,1,"Pathetic Service by this so called brand. 1 year ago, I ordered a set of hoodies while on the delivery I just got 1. When I ask them to return the order they just took the hoodie back and I got nothing back as the order was prepaid. They scammed me by tooking the prepaid amount. Disgusting service by them."
2021,2,"The ap itself is OK. Sometimes slow. Online shopping with H&M is terrible. Bad customer service, slow shipping. Something needs to change."
2021,5,Very user friendly
2021,1,I had placed an order about a month ago. I called the customer care 2 3 times they said it will reach you but is being delayed due to some technical error. Finally after a month I called them and they said the order can't reach me and has returned back to their warehouse and thus cancelled the order on their own. I later asked for a competition and they didn't provide any. So overall this is a pretty unfaithful app.
2021,5,Its quality is superb and has unique colors
2021,4,Good experience with delivery and quality of products purchased.
2021,5,Always mine fav❤️
2021,4,Good 😊

2021,5,Excelent quality
2021,5,Superb ✨❤️
2021,1,Forcing you to sign up next to the till to be able to recycle clothes? A better app would just give you a qr code instead of having to faff around - and now it doesn't uninstall
2021,5,The best..🧡
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Excellent
2021,5,Shipping out is fast but UPS delivery takes sooo long. As per quality of the product is awesome at it's worth to wait!

2021,4,"A great app, quite easy to use and everything works as it should do. The only downfall being that you get a restricted wishlist, meaning oyu can only have around 50 items in your wishlist."
2021,5,great
2021,5,👍
2021,5,Products at its best products plus the delivery time is satisfying
2021,1,Doesn't let you into the app. Some ad appears and you can't get past that page.
2021,1,Crashed not once. Website doesn't work either. I have bought stuff and can't check the delivery status.

2021,5,Excellent App.
2021,1,"There's this bug i recently came across on your mobile app, that it is enable to take login from my mobile app, when i tried to send a forget password mail, it didn't respond either. When i tried to do the same from my PC on your website, it worked perfectly fine. And i cross checked your APIs were also working fine on system but i guess your app isnt sending login info to them. Hope you can correct this soon, this even costed me to use my discount coupon on my purchase."
2021,1,"This is regarding my refund , 1.I received a mail saying refund is not successfull ,I asked customer care they said it's a glitch 2.Again I raised query then they said I received refund to check my account, I checked and I didn't receive. 3.Again I contacted 2 times,then they said to update payment account,I did still nothing. 4.Again I contacted ,they said I received money, to check , I checked didn't receive. 5.At last I contacted 3 times then they raised a complaint and still I"
2021,5,Good
2021,1,Not downloading it
2021,4,for best quality
2021,1,Poor servies
2021,1,"The worst app till date in terms of returning money, they can be sued in the court for doing such fraudulent act, its been more than 40 days they haven't returned my money back and telling me false information, I've called so many times but no result, they might can delete my review to look good in the eyes of other customers but im gonna take serious action against them as im lawyer so I've to now. they don't value customers money."
2021,5,Love itt
2021,1,"Pathetic services , sending entirely wrong/different product .Customer service isn't of any help... Been unable to return the wrong product from the past 3 weeks. Extremely poor service , tormenting customers. Consider the rating -1"
2021,3,Everything seems to be cool. But it would be more fun and exciting to shop here if there are more offers and promo events as well.
2021,5,🔥🔥🔥
2021,5,Very convenient
2021,5,Hugo Pérez
2021,1,Worst service After payment of 15 days they cancel it without informing and no refund received till now of 7 days
2021,5,Nice experience 🧡
2021,1,Blank screen when opening app. Deleting it
2021,5,Uhmm
2021,1,The app is really bad. I have to login again and again. You can't track your order in the app and they give you no notification of where the order is. Didnt expect this from a big company like H&M.
2021,5,Good
2021,3,"Shopping at actual malls is still the best option and YUP one more thing, can you please do make your service more accessible especially to teenagers like me who still doesn't have bank accounts or atleast have COD as one of your mode of payment. Thank you!"
2021,5,Quick & easy NOW after it finally let me put it in english
2021,5,Perfect app
2021,5,H&M is the best app to shopping
2021,5,"Easy to shop, great value for money, perfect."

2021,5,Very good selection of cloths. I will highly recommend you to buy cloths from here
2021,5,quality & Style cno need to compromise just go for it
2021,5,👍
2021,4,"Great app, it can be slightly inaccurate about the in store availability of items though."
2021,1,"terrible, way to many bugs"
2021,1,Delivery takes so long. Why bothering shopping online if you just go to the store to get the items right away stead of waiting for your package to arrives after 2 weeks. Ugh! Another reason why I love the mall.
2021,5,Op
2021,1,the app does not accept my valid Pincode number😤
2021,5,Amazing
2021,5,Good product and best rates
2021,5,Love this app

2021,2,👎service
2021,5,Super
2021,1,"Pathetic online services, not once and twice but each time they cheat by sending wrong sizes and products purposely and customer service is the worst amongst any in the world to even help a bit"
2021,1,Extremely poor delivery service. You would have to wait for much longer to receive your products then the expected delivery shown in the app. Even after contacting the coustom service it won't be beneficial. They don't even provide the phone number of the delivery man when they are out for delivery. When you order something it comes under or on the day shown in the app but it doesn't work like that on h&m. Since past 2 days my order is showing out for delivery but it never gets delivered.
2021,1,"I waited more than 1 week And they simply says Delivery returning to seller I'm really disappointed and I feel sad,I was about to give present to someone but now it's all ruined and over 😢"
2021,1,I have given a item for return it's been days that item is in return but didn't get any refund Please give me the refund
2021,5,Great. I suggest adding offer codes from time to time. Please
2021,5,"Love the styles, measurement is true to size"
2021,5,Byeee

2021,5,Very nice and soft fabric. And I wear with peace of mind knowing no slave in china had to work their finger bloody to make the product
2021,5,I really love H&M True to there size and the material of the clothes are awesome 👌 👏
2021,5,Good quality product
2021,5,Lovely! Works wonderful.
2021,4,Whatever i brought from H&M are beyond my expectation hope to say that h&M will never dissapoint me.
2021,5,I am just in love
2021,5,Nice
2021,3,Please add English language to EU countries section 🤐
2021,5,Great finds
2021,5,I have never had problems using this app. If you know how to use filters you can find good deals on quality products.
2021,5,Amazing quality
2021,4,eh
2021,3,Great products but very slow in refunds !!
2021,1,"Keep on error, i cant remove the items that i dont want... Log out n try to log in again, but cant sync my password.. Try to change new password, it's been changed successfully, but cant log in with it, i dont know why.. Apps is so lousy.. 👎👎👎👎"
2021,5,Great!
2021,1,"The app repeatedly rejects my password even after I just reset it. Even waiting 24 hours after a pw reset it still rejects. This has happened to me so many times. Additionally, you cannot change countries. At all. I was advised to delete my account and make a new one to change countries. You can't add to or cancel orders either"
2021,5,Good exp
2021,5,Excellent collection...bt at times d required size is out of stock
2021,1,Worst customer service ever.
2021,5,Great
2021,4,Bijna goed Kamer dat de levering opties beperkt zijn Om de goederen eerder te ontvangen zou ik het extra betalen
2021,1,"Alot of the time when you click on an item to look at it, a message comes up saying they have trouble connecting. Also does this when I type anything in the search bar so can't actually look for anything specific. Stops me buying things that I want as I can't click on the item and select a size to add to me basket. Probably one of the most annoying shopping apps I've ever used."
2021,5,All good
2021,1,"The app is fine ,but when the order is placed u don't get it on the scheduled date .they keep on pushing the dates and don't upadte you . So it's a worst experience"
2021,5,Gg
2021,5,One of the best shopping app
2021,1,I always purchase clothes and accessories from H&M. But this time I received a blank package with sealed on it. I contacted customer care so many times but still didn't got any refunds yet. Ordered the same item again because I never received it and sent images to their email but never got any updates about it. I never expect such things from H&M this is my first time it happened and now they're telling I will not get my refund back n it got resolved then where's the item gone?
2021,5,Bestest product...
2021,5,Absolutely the best ever staff in the world. For the second time in a row they tried to find my favorite jeans and found it. Thank you so much.
2021,5,Too good but pricr to high

2021,5,I love h&m
2021,5,Service is good good product one of my favorite brand
2021,1,"Lousy apps. Tried to purchase, slow process. Then remove some items, error. Tried to log out & log in back again, password doesn't sync. Then re-created new password, success, retype new password, DOESN'T SYNC! What is happening!!!!! Doesn't even deserve a 1 star at all."

2021,1,"The app and their system is quite incompetent in 2021. Unable to cancel in order within hour of purchase. When you buy an item and the same item goes on sale within the hour, you're not allowed to get the discounted item. Extremely incompetent, unless they're trying to hold on to all the pennies they can."

2021,1,"I personally love the clothes. But the app is so messed up. I've placed an order but the payment wasn't processed and when I refreshed the order was placed without any payment mode selected. When I contacted the customer service, the agent advised to cancel the order and order again and she mentioned that once I cancel the order, they show that it's on stock. I gave her the permission to cancel and reorder,she did so and all my products were out of stock.🤷What's the point of me wasting my time"
2021,5,Sexy app
2021,5,Excellent
2021,3,Ive been facing issues with the package being cancelled itself. I never get a call from the delivery agent and at the end of the day I get a cancellation code instead. I raised this issues quite a few times to the customers care and they assure it won't happen again but it hasn't stopped yet.
2021,5,This is the best clothing brand I found for my kid who is 4years old and had sensitive skin. She feels very badly irritated in tulle dresses of any other brand but not this one. My husband loves it so much. Totally stopped other brands after reaching out to H&M. Thank you for arriving in India.
2021,5,I have ordered the men jacket but can women why so careless
2021,5,Nice

2021,5,Always been best
2021,1,They trick you with promises of discounts. Once you go to check out they strip the discount off. Then when you manually reapply it with a discount code its £1 more than is advertised!
2021,5,V.good
2021,5,"If you want to wear clothes like celebrity you must have to try this app😍😍 , it's Just awesome 🤫❤️"

2021,5,Best hoodies experience ...
2021,5,I just love the quality of clothes
2021,5,Excelente.
2021,5,Love the app and the products
2021,4,Delivery is good. Product quality depends on how much you are paying. There are instances where I didn't get refunded for the items returned.
2021,5,Awesome always
2021,5,👍👍
2021,4,Good
2021,5,"I don't know why are people complaining about refund. I always get my money back within 10 days. You guys, please stop confusing others. My closet is all HnM!!! And quite frankly I can't wear anything else."
2021,1,No longer shipping to Puerto Rico? WTH guys?!
2021,1,"I was positively surprised at the variety of clothes that I could choose from, so much that I racked up over 200$ in my cart to maximize my first purchase discount. Lo and behold the next time I log into the app, everything is gone and I have to choose all my clothes again! By the time I get everything right, I discover that my discount has expired and the support made a fuss that the discount cannot be reissued. Simply speaking: I won't be buying there ever again."
2021,5,Love it!
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Good App
2021,5,Good products
2021,5,I like it. Simple and smooth.
2021,1,"I don't like how you cannot change the language!!! I live in Greece, but I don't read Greek. The application automatically put greek as a language. It is very difficult to use!!!!"
2021,1,I like the brand but honestly the delivery boy is extremely rude they do not want to deliver the order. Bad experience I had with the delivery boy.
2021,5,I hsve bought my shoe's so much I bought a 2d pair and t's are great too. but had to up my size
2021,3,Wonderful
2021,5,Good quality
2021,4,"Awesome... in terms of the quality as well as the pricing, jst awesome"
2021,5,Amazing experience
2021,5,Excellent!
2021,2,Super unreliable. Order cancelled after confirmation. Discount not returned back. Would prefer shopping at the store itself. This is pretty annoying.
2021,5,V.v.v. good
2021,4,User-friendly but would be more helpful if there is an English option for the language since it's an international brand anyway.
2021,1,How to change Language? You should have an easy option to change the language. Something like a flag or globe icon. I'm in Netherlands that doesn't mean i can understand Dutch.
2021,1,They Do not have replacement option and returns are very complex as you will receive refunds in about 10-15 days. And i applied my membership reward for my order which was equal to RS.300 but whem i returned the product i did not got that reward back for reuse and on calling their support they denied without looking into matter.
2021,5,Love it
2021,5,Good product
2021,5,Love it
2021,5,Super
2021,5,Amazing store
2021,2,- Online shopping doesnt allow customers to make instore returns/exchange which is inconvenient - App doesn't stayed signed in for some users/ crashes on opening - Password requirements too complicated - easy to forget and get locked out -The welcome email should include member number and even the member ID Barcode so it can be saved in case people can't log in -alternate ID/ phone number should be asked (as optional) when signing up
2021,2,Don't know why they never have anything good in XL size.
2021,5,I FLIPPIN LOVE H&M💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃👯💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
2021,4,"I don't know why, but I cannot log into my account despite I reseted my password twice. Any advice how to fix it?"
2021,5,Good
2021,4,Excellent
2021,1,Don't buy from H&M official app rather than use other apps which sells h&m clothes.because you aren't get back refund from them. I'm waiting my refund from two months there is no response from the h&m .
2021,4,Finest collection
2021,5,gud
2021,3,Hi H&M... I've registered a return which has been picked up but its not being shown on the app as Returned.... I'm worried about my refund status...Kindly check into this
2021,5,Great app
2021,1,Never buy form this app. If you decide to return they will not refund your money. I returned my purchase two months ago and still didn't get any refund. Their customer service is the worst. Whenever you make a contact with them they will say that you'll get your refund in next 7 days but you wouldn't get it even after two months. If you want to get frustrated use this app.
2021,5,Easy shopping using the app
2021,5,Prettyy gooodddd
2021,5,"Great App. I love shopping in HM the app always work pretty well for me, can't complain about the service, clothes or the App."

2021,1,I cant delete item from my cart. it kept saying error.
2021,5,My online shopping goes super smooth and fuss free.
2021,5,"Just like the physical store, the app experience is incredible as well."
2021,2,I payed 5.99 for next day delivery ended up coming four days late and when the item did come it was the wrong item :)
2021,5,A very good brand
2021,4,Still needs room for improvement; search queries & results are effective but stcoks are not up to date...
2021,1,"Return process is worst. If you are buying, be sure to keep whatever comes to you or returning process will kill you."
2021,2,It was the best app for online shopping but recently there are some issues within the app.
2021,1,Takes too much time for refund
2021,5,I love it
2021,5,Fashionable and reasonable price all are collection awesome I love it

2021,5,Perfect
2021,1,Check out doesn't work. Very buggy. Data entry drop downs enter different info then selected. It's actually scary.
2021,1,"Jan 2020, Pathetic experience. They do not take your shopping preferences seriously, and cancel without informing you, irrespective of the payment mode. Just one order out of my 3 were delivered. There's no clarity regarding refunds. Bad. Nov 2021, I still hold my opinion. Very bad delivery experience. They have a lot to catch up when it comes to shipping time. I have never received their deliveries within a week. You are expected to receive a letter for delayed delivery for every order placed."
2021,5,Everything is genuine
2021,5,Nice
2021,5,Love H&M
2021,5,great
2021,5,Gd
2021,5,Overall gud experience
2021,1,"Worst app ever . I tried to recover my account after my app got uninstalled accidentally but when I downloaded and tried to log in it showed wrong password. So I clicked ""forgot my password"" but never received the email at all . Lost so many points. Is this your intentional lame technique so that users lose points and have to buy your products at full price ????"
2021,5,Very nice products and of really good quality
2021,1,"Pathetic experience. Why have an online platform when you can't accept exchange ? First of all H&M sent me the wrong size, which didn't matched the exact fit of the same product at an offline store, then there was a pickup issue, finally the product reached it's destination but the refund will take ages to reflect. Degraded supply chain management, logistics support and yes they take more than a month to process your refund. Never buying from H&M online!"
2021,5,My fav wear shop
2021,5,Awesome awesome
2021,5,Great 👍
2021,5,I love h&m

2021,1,worst service and worst app ever used called customer care for more then 10 times but no proper solution for my problem😡😡😡

2021,5,I like them!
2021,3,Probably good
2021,5,Really good quality of products
2021,1,"Awful. The absolute worst app I have ever used. It is the only app where you can't physically type in what you are looking for and have it find results! Instead all you get is a page with a message on it that says ""oops! Where's the fashion"" I don't know love, ain't that your job!? Bloody infuriating! (for months it's done this so don't hold your breath for a fix). Also adding things to the basket and being met with ""can't check out now, try back later""... Well what an absolute waste of my time"
2021,5,Good app
2021,5,It's only h&m for my son.... Super soft material and lovely designs
2021,5,I love cloths and there product
2021,5,Outstanding....
2021,5,Nice app for Best clothing
2021,5,It becomes slightly difficult at times to insert some desired articles from your favourites collection into the cart but works perfectly other times nonetheless. Perhaps H&M could give this glitch in particular some room for thought??

Called customer care, got false promises from their end, lied about the expected date of delivery. Asked them to send me mail regarding the same. They lied about Non availability of messaging team and promised to mail in the afternoon once the messaging team is on duty. Never received the mail though. After calling customer support for three days, frustrated."

2021,5,Wonderful collection and very nice sense of fashion
2021,5,never regretted shopping at H&M both online and offline. most products sell fast though but they advertise good quality and various products.
2021,5,"Excellent app, great service, great products, good prices!"
2021,1,Sometimes the product does not show its shipment and it becomes impossible to return if it doesn't fit. Otherwise quality and delivery is good.
2021,5,Quality is top notch. Only problem is the size confusion...

2021,1,Don't trust H&m !!!! I returned a T -shirt which looked quite different from the picture but never got my money back . I didn't even get any kind of points in my h&m account . Give my money back H&m !!! Edit: i just called the customer service as i got an email from H&M about unsuccessful refund . But the interesting thing is that the only no. H&M provides in their customer service was a wrong number (It doesn't belong to H&M service ) .

2021,5,Best clths
2021,1,I have been ordering clothes online for years. But never had such a pathetic experience as I had with this app. Ordered clothes on 1st Nov. The expected delivery date was 3rd Nov. It is been a week now my shipment ia still stuck at the same place. They keep pushing the delivery date by 1 day every day. I don't think I will eceive my order tomorrow as per the current expected delivery date. I am gonna cancel the order if I don't receive it tomorrow.
2021,5,Simple and useful interface. Returns tracking can be improved.
2021,1,Being an international brand they could have invested a bit more in developing their app. Two things I have encountered in last week. The first thing is there is no option to track our return. After registering a return you will have to check with an agent everyday wether the return request stands or not. Second thing I have placed an order on 5th Nov and the money was deducted from my card but the order is still not reflecting in the app or I haven't received the order confirmation in mail
2021,5,Easy to use. Good product pics and easy to apply discounts.
2021,2,Please fix the bug in the shopping bag page quickly! Can't remove items from the bag once added!!!
2021,5,Great quality fast fashion

2021,5,Badiya
2021,3,Overall this app is too good but the only problem is the return process is little complicated. They should also add an exchange option in future.
2021,5,"Just one word, Comfortable"
2021,2,It says you get a 5€ coupon after collecting 100 points yet I haven't received it 👎👎👎

2021,4,"Fácil de usar aunque en la última actualización el proceso de pago es un poco raro porque, en cada paso, reubica la pantalla sin mostrar dónde está el cursor. Eso sí, en cuanto se escribe, el área visible se ajusta."

2021,3,"Everything's great. But there should be a separate option to select country and other language. For example if you select any countries from Europe, you will get the language in the selected country. And it's difficult to translate everything 😕"

2021,1,So bad return service I'm trying to return my order but it keeps showing some error and I haven't even got my refund for my earlier order it's been over a month. Literally so disappointed.
2021,1,"I would not recommend this app at all. Awful customer service, I placed a return but noone ever showed up despite placing the return multiple times. Delivery is extremely sluggish. I have had always spoken good about the brand and it's service but it has gone to worse apparently."
2021,1,Poor delivery service I wish I could give zero stars
2021,1,His refund service is very very bad i have not recived four months passed
2021,4,App Is good with further upgradation like easy returning option which was lacking earlier . But I don't shop like before because very less discounts . The point system is so boring and unappealing .
2021,5,👍🥂

2021,1,"Rubbish customer service. I bought a product from H and M and for some reason i have not liked it,so i have requested for the refund of my amount.It's been around 1.5 months since the customer care give me excuses and not refunding my amount back to my bank account.If there is a option for zero star,I would have given zero star instead of one."

2021,1,"It's been a month since I have returned my purchased goods, issue regarding my return is the sizing in H&M is fu#ked up. But still it's been a month, where the fu#k is my refund? It takes a minute to accept my payment, but for refund, it's been a month, where is my refund? The customer service is below sub par.... And that's me being modest."
2021,5,"Found it odd to see a big corp have a 5 star app for online shopping, but this app is really smooth and has everything you need. Really great job!"
2021,1,Worst app and worst service. 1st they dont even deliver the product and keep that on hold for 10days and later they cancel the product with out any intimation. Worst experience. Not once but trice
2021,5,I love it the baby clothes
2021,3,"Ok types,Bit slow."
2021,1,Iam rating this on the 42nd day of patiently waiting for my refund and and finally making me pissed off with the entire process of of my queries. They dnt even deserve 1 star. Totally disappointed
2021,5,My favourite shopping app
2021,5,Excellent app
2021,1,They cancel the orders after 5 days.
2021,1,This app always delivered my orders on time and worked well but idk what happened when it reached the end of october...it says to choose another delivery method as my location doesn't come in the area of h&m smthg but it always delivered it properly other times plus the delivery method isn't even getting changed...yelp

2021,3,I had ordered 1 trouser but it is was torn so I had returned it on Sept 11 but today is Oct 24 and i still didn't get my refund 😠 h&m equals to fraud
2021,5,Best shopping app.... Good quality products and the only problem is that discount are very rare. Hope we get it sometimes 😅

2021,5,Awesome
2021,5,❤❤❤❤
2021,5,best app for online shopping
2021,5,Good so far
2021,5,Good price
2021,5,I love this brand 😍❤️
2021,1,I thought this will have new fashion stored in it....but its all same
2021,5,A great app
2021,5,Very user friendly
2021,2,Meh
2021,1,"Teruknya apps. Dah nak checkout, tapi tak boleh buat payment. Semua dalam cart hilang. Bila buka balik apps, semua item takde. Kosong. Camne nak pilih?"
2021,1,Worst Delivery Experience It took 2 weeks toh deliver my order
2021,5,H&M products are way to good.
2021,5,Best brand everrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
2021,5,Brilliant
2021,3,"Just unsatisfied with return policy , otherwise the app is quite good and the delivery is on time and material is same but again if by chance you got different product it will take about a month to refund show in your bank account."
2021,5,👍
2021,5,"I reside in Ahmedabad, and after Covid the store in Ahmedabad is total failure. But the app is amazing 😍. Best and very decent shopping app for H&M Lovers. Just couldn't get my nerves Outta it 🤞❤️"
2021,4,Great app and collection is incredible but make this app more easy and simple.
2021,5,❣️❣️
2021,5,It's really brilliant brand 👏🙌
2021,5,"just want to say, best buying experience I had so far, customer care service is so friendly and they legit listen.they help you and guide you. I had ordered wrong size pants,I could easily return and today I got my money fully refunded.thankyou H&M."
2021,5,Good 👍
2021,1,The refund policy is terrible...
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Awesome...
2021,1,"Since the last two orders,they are sending me such bad products,not ironed,crumbled pieces of cloth and there's no option for exchange as well."
2021,5,Supurbbb..
2021,3,Ok app. Main issue is seperating options out into individual selections. It makes for needless scrolling.
2021,4,"Love this money saving app. It's a relief on the purse. From a American perspective to the Swedish, thank you."
2021,3,Over all it's good but when it comes to refund it take so long
2021,3,"I Love to shop in H&M, but what I don't like are the models posing, sometimes is just not posible to see the product so I just don't buy. I just don't get it... what is the point of such posing if you don't show the clothing"
2021,1,"Poor delivery service. One of my orders never got delivered, reached a dead end and the app never notified me about it. Had to call customer service to know about the order status only to discover that I'll have to cancel to order, loose the membership points and wait for the refund. Not convenient."
2021,5,Best online shopping app☄
2021,1,"Worst app ,they don't update you with returns ,just ask you to wait and have patience for months . It's better to do offline shopping ."
2021,5,I love H&M
2021,1,"Returns are too longggg and there is no such thing as exhange in this app. I recommend to order h&m products from Myntra. Very disappointed.Its been nearly 30 days,still haven't received my refund."
2021,1,"The delivery takes long and the return process even longer. It's been 2 weeks since the items reached their warehouse and they still haven't initiated the refund process. Whenever I try talking to their live agents, they keep giving me excuses and trying to pretend to help when nothing is being done. They lie that this is done, that is done. Now when I asked again, they asked me to wait for another 2 weeks-1 month."
2021,5,Amazing app for shopping
2021,1,Worst experice. Dont order. Slow service. Nobody come to pick up return goods
2021,5,But no any discount
2021,1,"Please offer the option of English in other countries too! Or even an automatic translation. Otherwise it's impossible for many people to use this app! So basically instead of scrolling through products causaly and ending up buying a bunch of stuff, I end up so annoyed that I avoid even going to the local h&m shop."
2021,5,Love H&m and love there great service
2021,5,best in the world
2021,5,Good time pass
2021,5,Best
2021,1,Mera to download hi nhi ho ke de rha
2021,5,Güzel marka
2021,5,I think we can all agree that H&M is everyone's favourite brand 😘
2021,5,Love it
2021,5,"I love h&m products and there material but one thing I don't like is there cloths are immediately go out of stock ,so it's request please bring your product available as soon they are out of stock."
2021,4,ok
2021,5,Nice app for shopping
2021,1,Worst app I have ever seen...Worst customer care...never buy anything from this app..u will regret it....bad experience
2021,4,"I wish they had reviews for products. So that before buying, customer could see how the item looked like on normal people."
2021,4,"It's not my favorite, but it's good!!!"
2021,1,I didnot get my refund yet
2021,5,Easy and convenient to use
2021,5,❤
2021,5,Nice clothes friendly service always satisfied
2021,5,",,🙄🙄🥺😂😂"
2021,1,Very worst app 💩💩💩
2021,5,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤H&M GOOD PRODUCT N VERY HAPPY TO HAVE H&M BRAND
2021,5,Awesome
2021,1,Well everything is just not fine in this app. They delivers the prduct but in case if the product is of wrong size or xyz..it gets very much difficult to return. And then the refund also takes like ages...you dont get refunds basically. You have to break the head taking to the customer care service.
2021,4,"Pretty good app, have had to use my desktop on occasion, but love the sale notifications."
2021,5,Nice app. Easy to browse for any clothing s and accessories etc. Love it.
2021,5,This app is good 👍

2021,5,Great
2021,5,Wonderful
2021,5,great products 👍🏻
2021,5,Amazing experience
2021,3,"It is not working well for plus members. I have ads everywhere in the app trying to convince me to become a member. The thing is I AM a member, in fact I am a plus member and I have my session on, but the rest of the app won't recognize it. Please make it cohesive."
2021,1,Worst shopping app ever
2021,5,"Amazing, 🔗🖤"
2021,3,It's nice app but still a long way to go. Couldn't understand why we need the app just to register points at the shop. Person number or telephone number simply works fine everywhere... Perhaps a way to push people to install app :(
2021,1,I wish I could rate below one star. H&m has one of the worst customer service in terms of cancellations and refunds. 6/10 times they can't fetch information just because they can't use their tools and when you try to contact them they just keep you on hold for minutes and minutes.
2021,5,I love the updated fashion and design of this brand
2021,5,😘😘😘😘😘😘
2021,5,H&M has great clothes very nice quality.
2021,5,I love the products
2021,5,❤
2021,5,"This brand has its own charm , and in india then have parter with ratan tata so that's why i buy their products quality top noch and best u can get in their price of sale amazing experience 😉"
2021,1,"I ordered a product and even paid for it but when i go and check my orders, they just show the order of last month no new order, and i dont even know if my order is placed or not, i dont even know if i'll get my refund, h&m please look for it"
2021,5,Good performance
2021,2,bad
2021,5,Лесно и удобно за използване приложение!
2021,1,Tired orderinh for here 4 times and it never goes through just sits in my pending for a week each time arghh

2021,5,Awesome
2021,1,Thought the products are good...but the refund process...and costomers service is too lame .... please improve it ...

2021,5,Love it awesome collection with very reasonable price ....
2021,5,Good shopping app i recommend to you all.
2021,4,Good
2021,2,hard to match the search keyword. wish they had the better UI. kids in bigger size has less option
2021,5,Cool app
2021,5,I love HndM fashion
2021,1,"I am unable to login, no email id is working,it always says email or password incorrect,whereas it is correct"
2021,5,The best
2021,3,"The personalized size chart is broken and gone, used to give you an idea but no more in the new update. Best feature of this app is gone."
2021,5,"Best best best experience, very easy to use the app and the customer service was also fabulous #kritart you are the best you always help me h&m thank you for providing such a amazing service to us❤️ love to shop from h&m only❤️💯"

2021,5,Great day
2021,5,Awesome 😎 products...my favourite brand
2021,5,Noice
2021,5,"Minimal , worthy and classy"
2021,1,Worst experience. Customer service doesn't work
2021,5,Good
2021,1,"I was unable to change the language to English because there was no flag icon anywhere in the app for me to do so. I have a Samsung S21➕, even after unintalling and re-installing. Frustrating"
2021,2,Haven't Tried¿¿
2021,1,"I am truly disappointed,I was only 37 points away from becoming a plus member but suddenly it shows that I have ZERO POINTS? EXCUSE ME? please fix this"
2021,4,Very nice clothes and spent hours just browsing for my purchases Notify me did not work for me. I could of ordered over 200 worth of clothes but every time I went to checkout it was sending me back to item Sold out. Not satisfied with shopping on line.
2021,5,So practical n easy. Love it!
2021,5,Always Happy with H&M great stylish pieces and great homeware also
2021,5,User friendly
2021,1,Don't order products from here delivery can take 2-4 weeks. Their customer service is not upto the mark and the process are not defined thus all you will here are fake promises. There are no clear resolutions to these problems. If you want to buy H&M products buy it from third offline stores. Even though the stock especially for men is very limited there; atleast you will get the product and wouldn't be harassed by the H&M.
2021,5,"The style , the material, everything's just so beautifully considered"
2021,5,"This app works great. I love being able to just open the app to see what's new at h&m. My checkout experiences have been great. Haven't had any glitches or troubles navigating around. So far, so good"
2021,1,"Been around 2 weeks, still haven't received my order. Nor any sort of message. Fraud!"
2021,5,Amazing
2021,5,"Really nice app, very good customer service as well"
2021,5,Easy to use
2021,5,Love it
2021,2,"The app has some features that don't work well: the membership barcode for in-store purchases takes forever to scan properly; the saved mesurements are reseting; and I can't order anything, the button doesn't work."
2021,5,Outstanding
2021,5,My sons fav collection is one and only feom H&M
2021,5,A++
2021,2,I can never find items that I favourite in my wishlist ever.
2021,5,I love most of the styles they have.
2021,3,Everything is good but it's really difficult to open account you need to upgrade you app if not then people will not order
2021,5,I just love it
2021,5,"This app really helps as I tend to lose my receipts, all in 1.. also when ur shopping your vouchers and everything for it is in the app so pretty good."
2021,5,I love H&M. Always offering best.

2021,2,"Late refund... It's says it will take 30 days.. Lol 😂.. why it take 30 days to refund customers money.. may be they investing customer money into something. Please refund the amount ASAP, you cannot hold the amount for so long... Myntra and other brand will refund immediate once they get the product..so please explain why you are taking 30 days to refund."
2021,1,"I ordered puffer jacket worth 2,999 but when it got delivered there was a cheap Jean inside. I want the return product to be picked ASAP and want my Refund immediately!!! Very disappointing!"
2021,5,I love shopping from this app.....one of my favorite shopping sites.... Services are good well on time.... Return policy is also nice..... product quality marvelous ......affordable and best quality products ....♥
2021,1,Worst. Never buy fom h&m online. If you retunrned a product you will never ever get your money back. I loose my 2300 rs. I hate them. Worst worstest. Customer service is so so worst when they can not able to answer your question they just cut the call and leave the chat. Never buy.
2021,5,Everything is perfect
2021,1,The worst shopping app..they don't refund my money from almost 1 month..... please don't download it
2021,3,"The app works fast. My compliant is thta it rejects address because ""it can't find it"" and simply disregards it. The Search for Postal Code is useless, i have an H&M nearby ""pick up store"", but the app does nothing with the Postal Code of that store. Therefore i cannot order what i need. Pity indeed."
2021,2,Everything was okay but I haven't received my refund and it's been almost a year
2021,5,Discount apply and free delivery is good for customers so save money.

2021,1,They have the worst return policy ever. With incompetent customer care executives who will rather waste your time than helping out. The customer care number is always unreachable. Don't put customer care numbers if you are not keen in helping out. I will rather order HnM products from another platform.
2021,5,Great

2021,5,always super easy to use for product search and for ordering
2021,5,"They've added more size options, like xl is almost evrytime there these days and I'm nothing but a happy customer to shop at h&m"

2021,5,"I love this app so far. This is my first order so I really wasn't sure of sizing. It depends on where they are made and price. I ordered two cotton shirts in XL and they weren't made in China! Yay! One made in Bangladesh and the other in India! I tend to order larger sizes, but was surprised to find they run very very large. I suggest your buyers order their usual size based on the sizing chart. Can't wait to shop some more."
2021,5,topnotch 10/10 100%
2021,1,"It has been 8 months I placed a return request. No response ! Please don't buy anything online from this app.If you get a wrong product ,you'll not able to return it because the courier boy will not accept it and on the other side you'll not be able to talk to H&M care .And if you,then they will say we will do something about it but will not."

2021,1,This app won't allow me to process my payment. I have erased all card information. Re-added all information. It just keeps giving me an error... I guess they don't want to take my money 💵
2021,1,These guys are offering a 70% sale but whenever you want to add something below 500 it errors and whenever you add something above 500 it accepts ...Truly disappointing .. Then what is the use of the sale !!!
2021,1,Where's my order it's already 10 days😡 Why is my order stuck at one place since 4 days😑
2021,5,Convenience and easy to use.

2021,4,"Has nice clothes, but discounts are less and also should have more designs."
2021,1,Worst app ...never delivers anything on time and gets cancelled ..also customer support providers are not good cause they give hope about every order details but in reality this is very bad Seriously not satisfied at all!!!
2021,1,"Don't buy from here, my experience has been that clothes will look bleached after a few washes. Other clothes from different brands that were within the same wash did not have this problem"

2021,1,"H&M products are great as everybody knows...but it's return policy sucks, it takes ages and ages to get your money refunded into your account... iam placing this one start for the products and the remaining four start is because of return policy."
2021,5,great site and product .....love the app
2021,5,Good app but it's very difficult to find products of proper size.
2021,5,Great fashion with comfort
2021,5,"Foarte accesibila aplicația, îți ușurează mult timpul pentru cumpărături!"

2021,4,Aws App 👍🏻
2021,2,Why can't I choose a region in Europe but keep the language of the app in English? I might live in France but I don't speak French. I think the region and the language should be separately chosen. Thank you. Looking forward to the update
2021,5,Love the qualities of clothes

2021,5,Love the app. Easy to use and no issues.
2021,1,Have lost my favorites for the umpteenth time again. Usually an account means being able to keep your favorites forever. With h&m you just lose your list all the time.
2021,1,On h&m it's my first experience...but my 1 experience was worst .... b'coz over 30 days and I can't back my refund .... never Shop from h&m app ... honestly
2021,5,Very good experience
2021,4,Improving day by day..
2021,5,Amazing product 👌🏼
2021,1,Soo the collection is good but I will suggest never buy online anything from h&m you can go offline shopping but trust me there is so much of size issue that I can't tell everything is just soo small and there is no return options you only have to cancel your order and the money return sucks like your money will take hell time to come in your bank account and please do not do COD
2021,3,Delivery is almost everytime delayed

2021,1,"Cea mai proasta aplicatie! Se blocheaza cand accesezi diverse meniuri, te duce pana la ultimii pasi pentru finalizarea comenzii ca apoi sa nu apara comanda inregistrata si cu greu reuseste sa actualizeze cosul..."
2021,5,My favorite place to make shopping

2021,5,Not bad
2021,5,Easy and fun 😀
2021,4,"The app authentication system requires users to be mindful about the credentials, its not like Google ones where you enter once and for all time. The app is designed to not store the account in it so after installing and first time use it dropped the session and required to enter password again. Like I ever remember it. Worst part is it failed to email me the link for password recovery in minutes. The first link came half an hour I left the store embarrassed and deleted the application :|"
2021,4,Great time shopping
2021,5,Love shopping online with you guys..super easy
2021,5,It provides me an accurate picture of the products that are available. During this time of covid pandemic I feel its more hassle free to shop online than in stores.

2021,1,How ridiculous without calling me or anything you just showing refused.
2021,5,Kay....
2021,5,"I love h&m , no cap"
2021,1,After waiting 8 days my Order got cancelled by the company 🤦 I did my first purchase from H&M and after waiting for 8 days I got a message that the product will be delivered today but then I didn't received any messages or call and then I checked the application and it says the order has been cancelled by the delivery company. I reached out to H&M they just gave me an email id and said then to mail them Not a great first time experience.
2021,5,Great fashion article and offers
2021,1,I can never get the app to load while I'm in the store so then I don't end up getting any points for my purchases. This is a really flawed system. And it's more difficult to shop with the app then it is to shop on the website.
2021,1,"Horrible app, payment fails 3 times"
2021,5,Works well for ppl who don't have H&M stores in thr cities. Love it. Thanks for amazing service ❤️.
2021,5,Vaey good product

2021,5,Very nice app
2021,5,"My experience with H&M , is amazing love to do shopping!"
2021,5,Noce
2021,1,My item still not in progress in a week tho..
2021,5,"Love how easy it is to shop on this app, maybe too easy!!! 😁"
2021,1,I returned my order and it's almost one month but I still haven't got my money back! They told me to wait and still didn't even refund
2021,1,The return policy is disgusting.They credit the return amount only after the item reach back their warehouse which usually takes 6-7 days.Post that it takes another 5-6 days to finally receive the amount. Thus this entire process creates a worrisome issue. Iam still patiently waiting for my refund. Rating 1out of 5 only because their customer care service has disappointed me more than enough by keeping the line off whenever I contact them n the agent in the live chat only keep asking me to wait.
2021,1,Checkout out transaction gets stuck at payment option . Even customer service can't figure it out glitch . Conversation will nowhere end up near solution
2021,5,Ik ben tevreden👍
2021,5,Easy to order
2021,1,"Terrible fast fashion brand, needs to work on better garment worker treatment and payment as well as not overproducing so much clothing, despite its greenwashing efforts, it's not a sustainable brand"
2021,1,Great.
2021,5,Great
2021,1,App cannot function

2021,1,"I had ordered a skirt from H&M and to my notice they have the worst customer service, just for a return of product it took ages, and for the refund it will takes more time, they have the best ways to harras a customer and make his experience worst, never ever again I'm shopping at H&M pathetic service."
2021,1,"App won't let me sign in unless I use Google smart lock, which doesn't work"
2021,5,Promt delivery and in one pack only

2021,5,Best app
2021,5,H&M with love..
2021,5,Good
2021,1,The absolute worst application ever. An intern could build a better app. Every time i open it it shows a message saying that some important service is done. I have uninstall it and download it again anytime i have to use it. And it would only work that one single time. I have lost so many points because the app wouldn't open.
2021,5,I love H&M
2021,5,I love itt
2021,1,"I forgot password, I clicked on the forgot password option and entered my email id and checked twice. I entered the correct email id, then it's showing Thankyou an email has been sent to you. But still I'm not getting any email to recover my password."

2021,5,I love it🤗. The quality is awsome
2021,3,I would have given 5 star... But it just asked me to give 5 start just before ordering

2021,1,Poor quality app . Customer service is just in name they doesn't solve the problem. When you proceed with check out you won't be able to complete your purchase. Extremely unsatisfied.😏😏
2021,5,Great to deal with. If returning its so easy.
2021,1,I returned an item on 2 months back and still haven't received my refund even after multiple complaints. Terrible customer service!
2021,5,I don't think we need to give any explanation for h&m It's just tremendous
2021,5,My favorite store
2021,1,No doubt colthes are good.. But man that refund speed...mine is stuck...process of one month...why people will choose you..when they are getting refund next day after return...
2021,2,too many updates! no one wants to keep updating an app they only use once in a while...
2021,5,I just love it
2021,5,The best online shopping app...has so many options to choose from and very hassle free to use...
2021,5,Amazing!!
2021,5,Nice collection 👌
2021,1,No discount on the app

2021,5,H&M made my life easier during lockdown for my son's shopping 🛍
2021,4,"App can sometimes be slow or time out, but other than that rarety, it's never failed me."
2021,1,"Excellent customer services but the most terrible app I've ever seen in my life. I spent a few days to place an order through the app but keep seeing error,error,error....finally I settled the payment tonight but the app said my order was not placed and CS confirmed that for me immediately. I am waiting for the money return to my credit card now and still cannot buy what I want...Since H&M has a strong CS team, highly recommend it let customers place order by email instead of this ""error"" App."
2021,3,H&m is sensation in fashion..
2021,3,Not enough sales
2021,5,Excellent
2021,5,Great quality clothing and great prices.

2021,5,"Aplicatia functioneaza foarte bine, sunt multumita de ea."
2021,5,Good stuff
2021,1,only order from the app if you have enough patience and if you have lots of money because half of your money will be stuck till they refund it. The customer service is amazing they listen and give solutions. For every order you place your order gets cancelled 2-5 times until your order is actually placed. They will provide you with discount coupons for inconvenience but you might not be able to use it because your order will get cancelled when you place it and it gets used in the process.
2021,3,Available pls on all addresses So pls essy to all can parched from that
2021,1,Worst.. When it comes to return and refund process... And some products quality are of cheap material.
2021,5,Awesome styles

2021,1,"The worst shopping app.I have ever come across, return policy is very annoying coz if wrong product is delivered and return is placed the agent doesn't accept saying it's a wrong product n adding to that helpline number is invalid n H&M live chat is useless."
2021,5,Excellent

2021,5,"The collection might be fantastic, the prices great, but the best part of it is definitely it's quality. I am in love with H&M. The fluffy, warm, soft, comfortable feel that liberates isn't something any brand can imitate. It is amazing, and worth every cent of it's price."
2021,5,My most loving online app
2021,5,I love this Apps
2021,5,"After updating the app,the wishlist I'm trying to see is not my wishlist. And it changes everytime to different person's wishlist when I refresh it. Please fix it why is it happening."
2021,1,"Got an error message after submitting an order. Tried 3 times to submit. Error. Error. Error. Opened the app the next day while I was in the store purchasing the items I thought I hadn't been able to purchase online, only to see 3 orders in progress from the day before. All 3 orders went through, and customer service had no way to cancel them. SO I'll now have 4 sets of the same outfits, and I'll have to go BACK to the store to return the 3 I never knew I ordered. Fix your app."
2021,1,Worst service
2021,5,Супер е

2021,5,Superp collection
2021,5,"Konnyen atlathato es rengeteg olyan dolgot talalok amit az uzletekben soha nem latnek meg, sokkal kenyelmesebb mint vasarolni szemelyesen. Easy to use and I found a lot of things what I wouldn't in the store, much comfortable than shopping in person.👌👍"
2021,2,Pickup system is very bad.. my package has picked up but return has not updated yet. H&m has scammed me
2021,5,love with H&M💟💟
2021,5,"Best service, fast delivery, good fashionable products, what else should we need, go for it"
2021,1,Address field is messed up. I always end up contacting UPS to provide correct address.
2021,5,Love love to shop at h&m.everyday great deals..on kids ..adult..men..
2021,3,"payment options too limited. you might as well add gcash, paypal, and cash on delivery here in the Philippines to make your service more accessible to people who don't own bank accounts, especially teenagers."

2021,4,"Love the app, making purchases sometimes, using membership and points - thanks for that! But the new feature - Style Quiz - is made for men only?? It shows me only male clothes. (The gender in my Settings is set to ""Female"")"

2021,2,"In-store mode is the main reason I use the app but it just doesn't work. When I choose a store through the in-store mode and click an item that should be in the chosen store, the app tells me that the item is not available on stores or that it's not available on the store that I chose. The whole point of this mode is that I could save time but it just doesn't work. I really hope this will be fixed."
2021,5,"Quality assured & value for money, affordable office wear, daily wear & casual wear......My favourite store."
2021,1,I ordered a sweatshirt plus a legging from them altogether but they missed to put legging in that order and sent only a sweatshirt which is really unexpected and disappointing as I have bought something from h & m first time and that first time experience was totally disappointing because of this mishap.
2021,1,I have returned the product but they havent refund my money.. Its has almost been 20 days.
2021,5,It's awesome
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Because you can choose from a lot of models and designs and i can find a lot of things for my size! Hoorey!yuppiii!

2021,5,Best!
2021,1,My app doesn't work anymore comes up with an error when I try to open
2021,3,"The app is okay. Don't know nationwide but in South Wales trying to open your app is like drawing blood from a stone, they have a sign in on their WiFi so it takes ages and annoys everyone behind you (there is no mobile signal in our mall). Just make the WiFi open! No one is writing their college thesis in your changing rooms!"
2021,5,"Usually, I didn't shopping online, but after one purchase, I'm addicted, love, love buying online, it is so easy, I recommend 100%🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

2021,5,Best app
2021,5,Superb service
2021,5,Worst app
2021,5,"This is a user friendly app, I also love their products and the whole e-commerce service / experience they provide"

2021,5,The shopping experience is excellent

2021,1,"Very pathetic service....I order blue and white t-shirt combo and received creame and black combo...further customer care is not reachable....if you are big fan of h&m...then visit physical store or go to Myntra. Don't buy through this app...this is the reason, now major brands are selling on Myntra as no company can match up to Myntra services. H&m should ban his app and sell it on myntra only."
2021,1,Products are fine but service is terrible. Ordered beige cargo pants but received black ones. I returned them as one can't exchange the products even when the mistake is from their side. I haven't received any refund yet.
2021,2,Nooo why are the clothes soooo expensive 😭🤲💔💔💔
2021,3,"Some time I am facing payment related issues, I think team will be fix it.... By the way I love H&M"

2021,1,"They have a bug in their app because of which you may have to change your address like 10-12 times for it to work. Plus their delivery system sucks too. Also, when ordered online, orders can get mixed up too. I love H&M but their app sicks big time."

2021,1,"Very poor experience of in-store shopping. I lost my imported water bottle in the store but I couldn't found it next day in the lost and found department of H & M of HUDA City Centre, Gurgaon. The place where I kept it was not covered under any camera and the staff blamed it on other customers might have stolen. Very poor support team. Beware, if you leave something by mistake, it would not be returned."
2021,4,I love hm
2021,5,More stuff and size selection on here than at the mall. VERY satisfied. Their regular old plain... ordinary... Hoodie jacket is perfecto. Price is shocking. I would have easily paid $50 or $60 for that hoodie and it was only 20 bucks. I got multiple. That's really just only one example.
2021,5,Super easy to use the app. Love that I can filter the ones I wanna see.

2021,2,Customer service on Facebook or insta even over the phone is freaking trash🗑
2021,5,A very good app for online shopping.
2021,1,"I'd love to buy, I'm huge pan of H&M .. but app has problems and also customer service is terrible.."
2021,5,Better than the Uniqlo app
2021,1,"Terrible refund process. 20 days how many more days required just to process the refund. Can you please give me the refund. Will you give me the refund. How many days do I have to contact the customer care. And why do I have to get sarcastic answer from the customer support team. Did you gave me the items for free, did you sponsored me the products. GIVE THE REFUND IMMEDIATELY"

2021,5,Amazing collection and app.
2021,5,Great app
2021,1,Pathetic customer care services. Sheer harrasment when you ask for exchange and refund. They will give you only fake assurances. Onky buy from store. Don't order from this app
2021,4,Okay but the app is really good but a RIP OFF like 30 Dollars FOR 1 SKIRT LIKE WHO DOES DAT

2021,1,Useless aap. Worst customer service. In live chat no one came live for 35min. No option for cancellations. Refund policies are not clear. I love h&m but the way they have developed the app it don't seems like one of the best brand.

2021,1,Worst app . It doesn't show payment option

2021,1,Have returned an item and it has already been 15 days I have not received my refund yet... Worst customer care service no body is picking the call... H&m look into the matter I want my refund as soon as possible

2021,1,One the bad experience ever. Two times I'm getting wrong products and they are delaying in returning my items. It has been more than 10 days and they are not responding to my complain with very poor customer service. H&M were good before only for their customer service and they have born the extra mile for their customer. I'm totally not happy and too much disappointed.
2021,5,Best experience
2021,1,Very nice
2021,5,Exceptional

2021,5,Best products and easiest app to use :)
2021,1,"They literally have not refunded my money and it's been more than a month. I have contacted them several times and they always just mumur and say ma'am few days. What kind of stupid company is this? 30 days refund policy seriously? You eat off of the interest of your customers. I'm literally going to sue you guys, for this."

2021,1,"Returns take way too long and the online list of orders doesn't even show which article is returned which makes it difficult to keep track of whether the refunds are correct, especially since it takes so long."
2021,1,The app is taking forever to install
2021,5,Hnm is love ❤
2021,5,Easy to use and works every time.
2021,5,Splendid

2021,3,The products were really good and the services are also nice but the return and refund service is really tardy and inefficient. I have recently returned three products and i have not received the complete refund and it's been a month.
2021,5,Good

2021,1,The items in the favourites list keep disappearing. No flexibility in choosing the language. It depends on the country. At least English should have been an option regardless the country.

2021,1,This app is not useful for online because they have worst customer service and they don't resolve the issue.I purchased few products but due to some size issue wanted to return it but they didn't send their person to pick it up .I have contacted them so many times every time same answer mam surely your issue will be solved and our person will pick your returned order and money will be refunded but it didn't happened and now it's six months to my request 😡.So please don't purchase from here.
2021,5,"I always love shopping from H&M but they always stock out my fav items, I'm a bit appalled!"
2021,1,Stores do NOT accept online purchase return!
2021,5,Abhi tk mera exchange nhi hua hai dress nah paisa mila hai
2021,5,"Easiest, most user friendly app I've used. The catalog is satisfying, with most items have clear images of each colour. Very good experience browsing thru every item. Just that the favourite item is limited to a certain amount of numbers, and that is a lil bit annoying."

2021,1,I had the worst experience shopping on H&M. I have returned and issue of return for over a month and they claim they will pick it up. But they just don't do anything about it. This is the 5th time I contacted H&M and they made the same claim. WORST APP EVER
2021,1,After 1weeks later of purchasing they kept returning the items itself. If the product back in stock they don't notify you at all.

2021,5,I have always good experience ☺😊
2021,5,Lots of options and delivery is very fast. Totally recommend
2021,5,Very good clothing and there is sizes available that's the main point
2021,1,The worst online shopping app. It takes 1 week to deliver the order but takes months to refund . I'm not trusting HnM ever again. Fix refunding process. Do something about it HnM👎👎
2021,5,Very good app
2021,5,Clothing material are good but i am plus member my points didn't add from last two months.. I ordered some conscious items... My conscious points is always 0...

2021,1,"I ordered from this app. I thought the stock would be coming from locally. NOooo. It came from the Netherlands, routed to Germany, forwarded to China until it arrived at my home country. The carbon footprint! If I had known, I would have walked in to a retail outlet."
2021,5,"Always love to shop H&M best Quilty clothes,"
2021,1,"Waste of time and data, They will cancel orders without explanation."

2021,2,"Frustrating... I moved countries, so I have my login details for the Japan settings. When I changed the app settings to the country I'm living in now (Aust), I can't log in. I try to make a new account while the app is set to 'Australia' but the app says an account is already made with that email and I should just log in. But of course, when I try to log in, it says wrong email or password. So I need to use another email to make a new account??"
2021,5,Great baby products
2021,5,Perfect!
2021,1,Return Policy Is Too Bad... H&m Should Pay Attention To Smooth Return and Refund Process.... Its Almost A Month I Haven't Receive My Refund.... Please Check It.

2021,1,"Breaks the website completely. With this installed, any time I try to acces H&M in my browser, this app opens instead and breaks the page. Incredibly annoying. Uninstalled"
2021,5,I absolutely live H&M clothing! I have been wearing them for years because the quality is usually amazing and they make it for all body types plus they are funky which is my favorite part!!

2021,1,"Greenwashing and horrible labor conditions for garment workers, awful fast fashion brand"
2021,5,Always my go-to
2021,5,"Love the app, colours and sizes always spot on."
2021,1,"Aucun intérêt, le vendeur m'a fait perdre 1 demis heures avec cette appli pour soit disant me faire une reduction de 30%. Cela n'a jamais abouti. Merci."
2021,2,"Produsele sunt ok, preturile sunt ok, magazinele fizice sunt ok, dar servicul de livrare este groaznic. Cand zic serviciu de livrare ma refer la econt, nu la firmele de curierat care chiar iso fac treaba cum trebuie. Sa revenim la econt. Informatiile nu sunt suficient de detaliate. Ti se spune ca produsul ti se livreaza in 2-5 zile lucratoare, dar niciodata nu se livreaza in mai putin de 5 zile. Daca vrei mai multe informatii dai este un site in rusa."
2021,2,Not user friendly. Takes forever to refund. Service is slow . Overall experience bad. Wouldn't recommend.
2021,5,Great app

2021,4,Best store app I have used. Integrates well with both online and instore experience. Good loyalty offers. There seems to be a glitch (hence 4 star) where you cannot select your locality when you first launch it and therefore cannot enter the app. Workaround is to select a different country and then change it back in the app settings.
2021,3,liked most of its product but Refund policy is painful... never ordering

2021,5,Brilliant
2021,1,"I just placed two orders in the last 4 days. Both were canceled. I've called customer service four times and been disconnected each time. They no longer use English speaking customer service. I was told on the last phone call that all items were out of stock when all items are in stock and were at the time of placing the orders according to the app. I kept explaining this but was still told that all items are out of stock. I got nowhere, no order, and was disconnected. Terrible customer service."
2021,5,Return policy is extremely poor
2021,5,Great collection
2021,5,Great interface with good service including delivery and returns
2021,5,Just love to shop true this app💜
2021,1,"The return take 30 days when it's arrive at h&m warehouse , and for refund it will again take 30 days that means I have to wait 2 month literally for my refund which is absurd, I try to talk to customer service which I have to wait for 20 min for their availability, they act so unfriendly and they talk like robot repeating the same word like cut and paste. So worst 👎"
2021,2,Where is my order. I ordered till 10 days and no improvements in deliver and there wis no complaint option on app
2021,5,"Very easy, was able to get the latest fashion without stress."
2021,1,Can't return the items
2021,1,Not downloading app at all only look it pending .......
2021,5,Hope it gets here tomorrow
2021,1,Worst experience. I returned the set of trousers I purchased. The refund failed and since then I haven't heard from them. The customer service contact details are also incorrect. My money is stuck with you people.
2021,1,This is really disappointing. I waited for 15 minutes for an agent and now I have to wait again because he left. Really unprofessional you guys. You need improvement in your customer service department.

2021,5,easy to use
2021,1,"Don't bother buying from them unless you want to wait 2 weeks for an order that says it was delivered in another state, just to find out it was actually damaged and sent back. Not only that but they won't resend you're items. Now your order is canceled. You don't get the refund for atleast another few weeks and their best idea is for you to buy the items twice now while waiting for said refund. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 never bothering with this company again. Horrible customer service also"

2021,5,"Quality is as expected of the clothes. The order was delivered on the estimated date which was in 3 days. The online order procedure was easy and safe. I am from Delhi, but my order was shipped by one of the stores of h&m in Thane, Mumbai. It was shipped safely by Bluedart services. I opted for cash on delivery, cause it was my first order to h&m. Now being a member of the h&m family, I get member discounts on various products by h&m."

2021,4,"Very good app and store. Suggestions: stop changing the filters from whatever I choose to ""Recommended"" in the middle of a search, constantly update the product list in real time so it doesn't show items that aren't in stock anymore and add more options regarding the order in the app: being able to cancel it or change an item/size as long as the order hasn't been processed or sent would be helpful."
2021,4,Only issue is that one can't add more than 58 items in the wishlist. Just wish that could be changed.

2021,1,"One of the scam apps ever. They put up 50% off and you can't buy any of it. Payment won't be successful whether it is debit card, UPI or even cash on delivery. And it is not because of item shortage. They simply won't let you have the offer."

2021,1,I've just spent 120£ in your Cambridge store at Grafton and because the app was not opening I did not get my discount. I'm very dissatisfied with how the person who attended me reacted when I asked if there is any other info I can give them (i.e. phone number) to get my points. I was expecting more mindfulness especially when it was an issue with the app and not my fault.
2021,4,"I've ordered quite a few times and everything is exactly what I ordered, never been disappointed before but I would like to see some of the clothes on guys who have more realistic body proportions."
2021,4,Not bad
2021,1,deceiving. no discount code and not free shipping when you dowbload the app. waste of phone memory

2021,1,Worst customer service from H&M their customer support service is doomed. PLEASE Don't shop from them. Also their delivery partner Delhivery is of no use. There's no way to contact and speak to an executive from H&M or Delhivery cause none of their give number works. Shop at your own risk. WORST SERVICE EVER.
2021,1,The shipping experience is awful. Ordered 4 times and all of them has delivery issues. Dont buy anything from their online store yet until they fixed their courier.

2021,1,"It's not opening in my phone I even create new email for this app but it still not opening ,it's always shows that email is not correct 😑"
2021,1,"The app is so stupid and so are all the people working in customer service. Due to a technical glitch, a part of my address was removed and I kept requesting them to edit the address and they kept assuring that they have edited it until one of them finally told me that the order was not delivered because of wrong address and now is back on its way to the warehouse. I spent 15 days on a single order only for it to be not delivered. Never ordering again."
2021,5,Fav.
2021,1,Had a bunch of stuff i recently put in my cart and then the stuff disappeared from my cart

2021,3,"1. Регулярно стирается раздел избранного. При попытке лайкнуть товар выпадает неинформативное сообщение об ошибке сохранения. 2. При запуске предложения рекурсивно открывается стартовый экран с надписью ""Нет соединения с интернетом"". При этом соединение есть (мобильный интернет, Samsung Galaxy A50, Android 11). Этот процесс сложно остановить при помощи кнопок внизу экрана (назад и домой не работают), помогает только force stop. Пробую переустановить, но, по идее, такого быть вообще не должно!"
2021,4,"Good app, haven't had any issues with it so far. Easy to use, though navigating the membership options can be a bit long winded."

2021,5,"H&M is such a fun site to shop from. They have a variety of clothing to suit everyone's needs. I absolutely love shopping from H&M due to its diversity of petite, plus size and tall ranges. Also, when they have sales during the year."
2021,1,I don't how long your delivery process. It's more than 14 days i bought still in transit. H&M Malaysia do you want me to launch report at KPDNKK about your service.

After not recieving the refund for two months I called the helpline and after a long conversation was told there was a minor issue and they would issue it in the next week. Needless to say, I still have not received my refund. H&M, please fix this."
2021,1,Products always out of stock. It's always the same sizes that are constantly out of stock. You'd think since you're shopping online popular sizes may be more available but nope. Even worst than shopping in store.

2021,1,"I ordered a product and I used one of my most crucial membership vouchers while paying for it. Unfortunately they had to cancel the order because it was the last in their inventory and it had some defects, which I totally understand.

2021,5,I just love this store have done so for many years and during the lockdown learnt to love the app even more .... The app is easy to navigate and find items plus has a great feature to send a email if your size is out of stock... On travel you can almost find a store in most countries so I'm always on the look out for unique pieces or collaborations. For wardrobe basics it's 100% ... also member discounts and voucher offers after spending a certain amount just adds that extra touch ...
2021,5,Good but hope it ll give more offer..

2021,1,"When I had asked for refund in 2020 of 1748/- the case was dismissed by stating falsely statement that it was never delivered to the customer and therefore, the status was 'undelivered'. So, where did you fall again and injured your brain to be sending mail everyday twice, refund pending of 1748/- only to be again not giving my money back when asked from customer care. Either provide me my refund or stop sending this nuisance refund scam mails to customers"

2021,1,"Completely disappointed with H&M's service. First, they forget to mark the returned orders as 'Returned', hence the amount refunds never were initiated. Second, once they were initiated, they refused to refund amount for a product without ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER until I contacted them. Finally when they filed the complaint, they didn't revert back for 15days until I contacted them-- and they told me that the product they received was incorrect. When asked for evidence, nothing was provided."

2021,1,Completely ridiculous that you can't have English as a language in Europe with this new update. Not everyone who lives in a European country speaks the local language.

2021,5,Absolutely love on line shop and the app. Quality of clothes matches great price. Clothes for kids wears well and I'm not wash it often. Our girl with autism Absolutely loves designs and feeling of the materials. Plus lots of clothes has been made from recycled materials. Very happy all around.
2021,2,The app is OK but there isn't a single solitary thing in stock.
2021,3,App is good but there are people in Norway who are here temporarily and do not speak Norsk. It would be beneficial to have English as an option in language.
2021,5,Adoro questo app...e così facile da usare che spendo troppo!!

2021,1,Just a trash
2021,5,Extremely user friendly shopping app
2021,1,"Didn't even manage to order. Getting something in the cart takes 15 to 30 seconds of waiting. Some articles siply fail to load. Then after going through the pain of putting 10 articles to the cart the cart page crashed after entering the discount code and the cart was empty. Horrible experience, and it's a pity because visually it looks nice"
2021,5,I love H&M garments and accessories. Their quality is excellent and have wide ranges in everything to choose from.
2021,5,"I love h&m its so good, quality is great and really convinient for me ans my family."

2021,1,Worst! The app is trying so hard not to deliver in my area. I live in delhi. My address is correct but the app cannot recognize it so i can't order anything. Where else through other online apps i am able to purchase my orders in the same address. Great work H&M
2021,5,Quality clothes
2021,5,🤘
2021,5,Great easy to use app
2021,1,"Echoing other reviews talking about their orders timing out, canceling and giving errors (and the discounts having to be reapplied). Contact customer service who will just tell you ""there's an error right now, try again at a later date"". I was also told by the rep (Jade) I'd be sent an email when the error is fixed but I'm willing to bet that I won't be receiving any email. Can't retry to order in my browser because when trying to use my member offer on my order I end up on an error screen."
2021,5,I like H & M
2021,5,The best fashion that comforts you
2021,5,🤗🤗🤗

2021,4,+ mostly everything - sometimes the status of some items (in stock/out of stock) is not updated in real time and the app lets you buy things that are out of stock...a few days later you get an e-mail regarding the out of stock items.
2021,5,Great clothes Great prices 👍🏾
2021,5,My favorite app
2021,1,"The delivery experience with H&M is pathetic! You are lucky if you get your order in time. It might be possible that you do not even get your orders due to the bad delivery services and after all the back and forth, they ask you to reorder."

2021,5,"Easy to navigate, incredible choice. Great fabrics and value for money"
2021,1,"They updated the app that makes shopping extremely frustrating as if it wasn't bad already. You have to press back arrow just to get back to the menu section (it existed before). Idk who came up with idea of putting all the kids sections in one giant messy pile. Previously it was automatically separated by gender and age, easy and fast. Now you have to manually filter out gender, age, and even clothing type several times before you can find ANYTHING. Shopping certainly made NOT easier."
2021,5,Nice and easy. I really like the H&M Shop and their app.
2021,5,I have been H&M store few times and I don't have my phone with me. So I did not get discount off sale for me.

2021,5,"H&M has definitely raised it's game! I love the H&M fashion & H&M Home. The quality is amazing. It is not just cheap and cheerful but great prices and quality. Especially with their home section. The app allows you to shop really well, with a clean, simple and buyer friendly design. It's a real competitor and challenge to Zara in every way. Before I mainly shopped Zara but now I have to equally shop H&M."

2021,1,"Worst online shopping experince ever. Beware: it's not 10 buisness days to process, it's 11. I contacted H&M twice about the issue (because the 11 buisness days puts me over my contract for my current living address), H&M was super unhelpful and slapped me a ""here's a 15% off your next order"". . . Like gosh, thanks, that 15% off is gonna make up for the package getting thrown away. Tldr; I gave a one star because shopping online with H&M is super unreliable."

2021,1,Don't buy anything from this cheap application.. if you don't like any product and want to return it.. they will surely pick up the product but won't refund your money.. I'm facing this problem for so long time... it's an appeal not to buy anything from this.. (-ve stars)

2021,5,"Perfectly usable app for shopping. Inuitive interface. Layout is organized and nice looking. Only 60 items allowed in the Favorites list, but that's my only complaint. Nice features: no ads, access to plus sizes, and a barcode scanner so if u dont find the right size/color in-store u can easily find that exact item in app. Everything ships on time. (formerly i complained of bugs. they were fixed, so now no complaints again"

2021,5,Amazing 👏
2021,1,Worst customer care services. I am following for more than 2 months for refund and they just keep asking me to wait for 30 days everytime and they don't have any records of my issue. Quite unprofessional.
