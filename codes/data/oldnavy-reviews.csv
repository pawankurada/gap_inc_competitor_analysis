2023,"This is the worst shooping app ever. It won't open 70% of the time, and when it does its stuck on white screen and freezes my phone. I have a new phone btw not an old one. And if by some miracle you can get onto the app to shop it will barely let you see 5 items before it crashes or freezes. I've uninstalled it, updated it, messed with it in settings, and it's still horrible. Just use Google to shop.",1
2023,"Hit or miss on whether it even loads, too many items make it cluttered and slow (if you have 1 shirt in 13 colors, just list it once and not 13 different times!), frequently sends me ALLLLLLL the way back to the beginning of the scroll when I back out of an item page. That's a long way to go back when you have 10 of the same general item with 13 different colors listed individually. I've given up on quite a few shopping visits because of this.",2
2023,"After using the app only a few days, I can honestly say it needs work. As someone also mentioned in the reviews, Old Navy app does NOT need to make a listing for each item and its different color options. They should really just have the item once, let us click, and choose a color, mainly to save the user time from scrolling and from laggy app experience. On top of that, the app itself is really laggy overall and it's hard to navigate through when I'm trying to compare in-store prices vs online.",2
2023,The app has never worked properly and has only gotten worse with time. One of my biggest complaints being you can no longer make your card payment in the app. This is only second to the fact that if you are browsing and select an item to see colors and sizes and then go back to browsing you are returned to the top of the page and completely lose your spot. Get it together.,1
2023,"The app has always been a bit hit or miss, but it's been basically unusable for months. I can no longer pay my CC on the app either. It hasn't updated since March, even though the payment history and balance is correct when I call. The favorites page never saves anything even when logged in, if you're even lucky enough to get to the shopping pages. Usually, it just gets stuck on a loading page. I'm just going to delete the app and only shop in store. It used to work great but not anymore.",2
2023,"App has been super glitchy, doesn't load properly. App keeps telling me pages cannot be found, when I'm scrolling through items it will put me back at the top of my search. It does the same thing I've looked at an item too. I've also had issues with my credit card payments not going through on the app. It's way easier, and safer, just to use the browser. The app isn't worth the hassle anymore.",1
2023,"The app has been extremely glitchy for a while now. When trying to scroll, the app hesitates and idles each time to move down the page. If I click on an item to view and hit the top back arrow to go back, the page refreshes and takes me back up to the top instead of staying where I left off. Because of these frustrating issues, I have not purchased anything out of frustration of having to repeatedly start over or the app taking too long to respond to a simple page scroll.",2
2023,"The app seems to lag alot. Occasionally, I'll be searching and the app will just close. Another frustration I often encounter is when I click an item to view more images, colors, or sizes and decide to go back, my place does not get held. It sends me back to the very top and I have to find my place each time.",1
2023,"I feel like the rating of this app is just based on the store and not the app. The app is terrible! Everytime I download it, I have to delete it again and again. Nothing improves. Sometimes it doesn't load, sometimes it tells you an item doesn't exist, it doesn't take you back to the same spot on the page after you view an item, etc. Needs a lot of work",1
2023,"This app never works well. It sends you back to the main menu if you click to go back from looking at details for an item. So then you have to find where you lost your spot every time. This happens when you add something to your cart too. It takes forever to load and it's not me, everything else loads quick. Target, Walmart, h and m. All quick. For how much money this company has, you'd think they'd have better technology.",1
2023,"The Old Navy app has been consistently frustrating and glitchy for months now. When I try to load the ""shop"" page, it gets stuck on a loading screen permanently. When I try to open the categories for shopping, sometimes it opens, sometimes not. And half the time even if it opens, when I select a category to shop, I get an ""uh-oh something went wrong"" page. So frustrating. Frequently resets me back to the top of my search. Just a really obnoxious unreliable app.",1
2023,"App has not been able to load consistently for months. Just gets stuck on a loading screen. On the few times it does work, I can do one search and then it will get stuck. Super inconvenient when I want to see my rewards or supercash to use in store. I used to love making in app purchases, but I haven't been able to make any since around the new year. Gap, Inc... FIX YOUR BROKEN APP!",1
2023,"The app is super glitchy. If I click on an item to see more sizes, color, etc., it doesn't hold my place and just puts me back at the top of the screen. This makes me abandon my shopping spree entirely. I'm not going to repeatedly scroll through the same 100+ items just to get back to the same item I was looking at previously.",1
2023,"I love Old Navy and the sales, but the app is really unreliable. Often doesn't let me sign in so I have to use the browser on my phone instead. Today the app let me sign in but loaded some stuff slow, and also when I would tap to view an item and then go back to the main list I was at, it would shoot me all the way back to the beginning after I'd scrolled down past hundreds of styles. Very annoying.",4
2023,"This app is so bad. It takes forever to load any items while you are browsing. When searching under ""Women's"" it will consistently give you an error stating something went wrong. While scrolling through clothes, it will randomly kick you back up to the top of the list to the very first item. It's just so bas, avoid this app at all costs.",1
2023,"Consistently one of the worst shopping apps I have ever used. I have to open, close, and reopen the app several times in order to get it to work. Even then, it tends to crash and exit out of the app on its own if I'm on it for more than 5 minutes. Oftentimes items that are supposedly in stock will say out of stock when I try to add it to my cart. Using this app is never an easy or pleasant experience.",1
2023,"I love Old Navy, but this app sucks. It hardly ever works, (crashes, stays stuck on the loading screen, constantly takes you back to the top of the page for no reason) and NEVER works during a sale. I'm almost never able to successfully complete an order before I have to give up out of frustration. PLEASE fix this.",1
2023,"It won't load pages. Multiple error messages. It's twitchy and glitchy. When you are scrolling and look at an item, it takes you clear back to the top of the search when you exit out of viewing that item. Beyond annoying. I can barely shop with this app let alone access my credit card payments/info without a fight. Can't stand it.",2
2023,"Old Navy's App is terrible. Please pay for better programmers. The app never loads up any items pages recently, it freezes all the time, and it's overall janky user interface when it comes to selecting a different color of item to be shown has to scroll through every other color before it gets to it. I stopped using it because it's so bad.",1
2023,"Update: 6/11/23 - This app is awful. Super glitchy. So bad I can barely use it and just end up going online. I can't understand why this app feels so amateurish/low quality. I'm annoyed by the login feature. Maybe this is my phone, but whenever I use the app it doesn't automatically save my password so I have to type it in each time. Again, could be my phone is the issue. Once I get into the app though, navigating feels clunky. It works and I can shop but something about it is just clunky.",2
2023,"This app hardly ever works. Pages won't load, will randomly return me to the top of the page as I'm scrolling, hard to search for items, etc. I am continuously checking for updates when I use the app to see if it will resolve the issues, and after months of the same problems, I've reached max frustration. Time for a revamp Old Navy!",2
2023,"The app works ok if you are willing to scroll for hours to find what you are looking for. I get almost daily notifications for sales, but if you try to click yhe notifications just to look at the sales, you will sit until you are old and gray waiting. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, I keep it updated to the latest version at all times, and still I cannot shop the sales unless I just use the website.",1
2023,"Old Navy app and website is the glitchiest and worst shopping app/website I have ever used!!! First went on regular computer to shop online, it wouldnt let me log in, kept saying error and need to refresh. Tried that for half an hour, gave up and decided to download the app to finish my shopping. I wanted to delete an item off my shopping cart in the app, kept telling me error and still had the same item twice in my cart which I couldnt remove. I spent an hour trying to PAY for my stuff!",1
2023,"The app closes repeatedly. It often won't load and gives me an error message when I try to shop. When it finally does load, and I'm able to shop, it's a very frustrating experience. When there are many items to look at, after clicking on something, instead of going back to where I left off, the list reloads to the beginning and I have to scroll back through everything. When there are 200+ items this is very tedious. I haven't purchased anything in a long time because of this.",1
2023,"This app makes shopping impossible. If you click to view an item more closely or even put it in your cart, when you return to your shopping it puts you back to the top of the list, and you have to scroll ALL the way down again. When you make changes in your cart, it then changes the order of the rest of the items in your cart too, so you have to go back up to the top again. Any time there's an update, I have to uninstall and reinstall, because the app stops working. This app is terrible.",1
2021,"The new app is time consuming. I can't pay my ON card thru this app, there is always an error--so I have to log in on my laptoo. When you click on an item to see color options/sizes, when you go back to the list, it starts at the beginning, sooo frustrating. When searching for Men's items, using the size filter ""Tall"" is not an option, so you just have to scroll thru to see what is available. I'm sure there are other issues, but these stand out the most. I love ON, but this app needs work!",2
2021,"The new app is awful! It never works properly, I can't access my order history or wallet, it gives an error that something went wrong or temporarily unavailable. Very frustrating. Also, when browsing, if you select an item to view more details about it, upon going back to all items it brings you to top of page, not where you left off. Selecting a print when multiple print options are available is very confusing. I don't like anything about this new version.",1
2021,"Can't access credit card information to pay bill. When shopping, when you're done looking at an item, you get sent to the beginning of listings instead of where you left off. Also rearranges the order of items displayed. So I don't click on many items unless I really, really, really want to see more about it. Probably could have made more sales off me if this app were more user friendly. Super annoying...",1
2021,"Returning to search results from item details sends you all the way back to the very beginning of the results, even if you have a couple hundred results to sift through. All right, I decide to simply add items to my favorites list from the search results page, and sort through them later. But the app does not save my favorites, as I discovered 40+ items in. Borderline unusable if you want to make a large purchase or think at all about what you're buying.",2
2021,"I love the ability I have to scan barcodes to find the item I'm looking for although I wish there was an option to choose a size after scanning the barcode. It also requires me to sign in constantly and its frustrating, especially when I can't even track my orders because every time I go to my orders it displays an error message. Ever since the update I can't do anything without it saying something went wrong and just doesn't work.",1
2021,"The old app was a pain. It froze constantly and took forever to move things in your cart. The new app doesn't freeze as often, but it has one glitch that is highly irritating. Whenever you look at an item and back out, you are brought to the beginning of the section. This could be after scrolling down dozens of items. Wouldn't it make more sense to resume where you were at previously? Changing this would make the app infinitely more user friendly. Also, why was the Tap to Apply option removed?",3
2021,"The new update is trash. It can't be that hard if other stores can do it? My complaints are all the same as everyone else's. Slow, the app never opens right, impossible to browse or sort efficiently. I think I'm done shopping ON until it's actually easy and affective to use. Saving time is the point of having an app. This one absolutely doesn't do that for me.",1
2021,"The new app is extremely annoying because while you're browsing a giant list of items, you choose something to look at closer, then back out to the list and it puts you back to the top of the page rather than where you left off. I've submitted app feedback multiple times but I'll be using the mobile site til it gets fixed. Edit : after posting, I'm so glad to see almost every other review is about the shopping/scrolling issue! Maybe they'll eventually fix it but it's not looking promising",2
2021,"The updated app is worse than the previous version. The only improvement is having Super Cash codes available at checkout without having to log in again. The filter feature is useless, the low to high/high to low price sorting feature is gone, the fit bars (overall size, chest, waist, etc) are gone so you must read reviews to determine if something is true to size, after viewing an item you are returned to the top of the page instead of the last item viewed, and the Factory option is gone.",2
2021,"I like the Order History in the old app much better. It was easy - all the important info is on 1 page with pictures, order date & number, status, all partial shipments, cancellations, delivery date etc. It utilized colors and was intuitive. You didn't have to click all around to get what you need. The new design is all text, unappealing and hard on the eyes. I have 40+ orders and it's a pain to navigate.",3
2021,"The new app is not user friendly at all, especially the checkout page. I would chose my ON credit card as the payment option and then put in the discount code and it would switch the payment method and put in a different code that raised the price. I had to redo the checkout multiple times to finally get it to work. Sometimes the account page doesn't load so I can't even make my credit card payment. Please fix the flaws or go back to the old app. It was clunky, but better than this.",1
2023,"This app is absolute trash. When clicking on the Shop option and going into a certain category, you'll get a ""something went wrong"" error just about every time. If you click on an item and back out, you will return to the top of the page instead of where you were on the list. The filters for size and reg/tall are basically useless. Maybe it's just an Android issue, but it's very frustrating considering how many emails I get from Old Navy.",1
2021,"What a downgrade!!! The flashy new features don't hide the terribleness of this app. The search and filter feature are unusable. The search feature doesn't pull up what you are searching for...I literally typed the name of the item and none of the items pulled had the words in the title. The ""filter"" feature doesn't narrow the scope. Seems like they tried but released something half finished. Old Navy, you can contact me for more info. I ran out of words on this review so I erased the details.",1
2021,"App is easy to use but when you scroll through and click on something, and then go back to the list, it starts you over at the top. Very frustrating. Considering it is a continuous scroll i could pass 100's of dresses before finding one i like. Only to go back and have to pass the same 100+ items all over. Too time consuming.",2
2021,"This app CONSTANTLY give you a ""something went wrong message"" where it doesn't let you do anything. You try to log out and it give you a ""sign out failed"" message and it just doesn't let you do anything. After countless attempts, I have no choice than to use my computer only to track a package. And, when it's not getting stuck, it constantly logs you out. In my opinion, it's a useless app.",1
2021,"Old Navy... What happened?? This was always my go to for basic men's essentials like Tees and shorts. But the new App. Is horrendous! You cannot find anything you want quickly. The only good thing about the app., Is the product pages are finally faster. Also, the Awesome vast selection of items has disappeared!! Very limited selection and it seems all Tees have pockets now with fewer color selections. Everything seems to be in fewer colors and options. Just sad it's come to this. ??",1
2022,"Too many glitches to function properly. I can't even add more than a few things to my cart before it tells me ""something went wrong"". After trying to build my order and getting interrupted for the third day in a row, I just switched to the site in browser. Unfortunately that's terrible too! Between the app and the website, it completely messed up my order, duplicated some items and dropped others - which are now sold out and/or I won't get free shipping on. So incredibly frustrating.",1
2023,"The app is super glitchy. I will sign in to shop or check my card balance, but then it gives me an error page constantly (my login credit are not incorrect, it's almost like a connection issue with the app). When I am shopping it won't save things to my Favorites list. Also when I click on an item and I want to go back to keep scrolling, it takes me back to the start of the page instead of saving my spot. So, I have to scroll down to where I was at. Super frustrating.",2
2022,"This app constantly has issues: can't load pages, jumping back to the top of the page once you click an item, not saving favorites, and more. I just went through and favorited things I liked since I had to scroll back through the entire page every time I viewed an item. I went to my favorites, and it's completely empty. This app has no issues notifying you about sales multiple times a day, but when you go to shop, you can't simply browse, save, or purchase items without some issue arising.",1
2022,"I'm sure it's great in theory, but unfortunately, when I select a category, it just hangs... sometimes it will load, but more often than not, it doesn't. And if I jump over to look at my bag, I can't return to whatever I was looking at on the shop tab. Search filters aren't helpful - especially with sizes. the app's in store inventory is never accurate. It's easier to just go shop in person, because so many items are incorrectly marked ""unavailable"" at those stores according to the app.",2
2022,"Glitchy App When it works, this app is fine, but it's constantly freezing and glitching. I get a ""could not refresh"" screen frequently, and it also keeps telling me my rewards points are ""temporarily unavailable"" and to ""try back later"". It's gotten to the point that it happening so often that I've just gone back to the actual website for my online purchases. They really need to work out these annoying bugs.",2
2021,"I am not liking the new app experience at all. It is super hard to navigate through the app and find things. And the worst part which is a big pet peeve of mine is when I am shopping and click on an item to add or just look at, when I go back to browse on the previous page, I have to start all the way at the top again. In short, it doesn't save your spot. The layout is ok but I think it needs some definite tweaking.",1
2022,"I agree with other reviewers. The app is glitchy and super frustrating. It asks me to sign-in every time. I also enabled the fingerprint to help me avoid the issue but it doesn't work. As I'm browsing, it abruptly stops and takes me back to the main page. This also happens at check out. I swear it makes me want to delete it and never look back.",2
2022,"App is very slow, and 99% of the time nothing loads. If the app does load, and you click on an item, 99% of the time the app will crash. I've passed over many sales, and many clothing items, because it is easier to drive to Target (and use their app and drive-up feature) than it is to deal with Old Navy's app and curbside pick-up service.",1
2023,"Operating on a Google Pixel 6 XL. They say they've made updates to fix bugs and streamline the sign in process, that is a bold faced lie. Now when I try to browse through app, if it even wants to load a page, it will sign me out multiple times. Pages randomly reload when browsing. Filters don't work the way they need to at all. Used to love using this app but over the last year it has gone down the gutter with functionality. Get it together developers! ??",1
2022,"This app is trash. It is always so glitchy. It never keeps me signed in. When browsing, after you look at an item and want to go back to the main browsing page it returns to the top, not wherever you were and it puts the items in a different order, so you can't even go back to find where you left off. So many error pages. I love Old Navy, but I HATE using this app!!!",1
2022,"I love Old Navy and order here often. The last week plus, it will not let me view products or add to cart! This bug is sending me to the log in screen every time I try to view or add to cart. When I log in, it returns me to the home page. Then, when I try to view the product, it sends me back to the login page once more. I would have purchased orders in the past week if I could! You are losing money! Please fix so I can order what I want!!!",1
2023,"Shipping is $9 if you don't meet the threshold for free shipping ($50). Met the threshold, go to checkout, and there is a $7 shipping charge. ??? No way to contact customer support. Every time you hit the back button, it will start your search all over again. Many of the sections of the app simply won't load or do not function. The filter options are a joke. Much of the items ""available"" for sale are not available at all. Horrible user experience.",1
2023,"The app lags a lot before and after updates, when it loads at all. It is not all that easy to navigate because it is slow or it doesn't save your information so I always have to log in or navigate as a guest account. I enjoy shopping in stores anyways, and the app used to be easier to navigate, but there is rarely a time where everything runs smoothly anymore.",2
2023,"The app, while relatively nice, likes to refresh and put you back to the top of whatever you're looking through after some amount of time, regardless of if you're scrolling or just looking at a few things. And if you're looking at a broad spectrum, good luck getting even halfway through without it sending you back to the top of the page.",3
2023,"""Something went wrong"" is the only thing i get. My app is up to date on galaxy s22, but i cannot for the life of me shop on it. No page opens up. So i get fed up and go my web browser. Another issue the app has is when you are browsing and clock on an item to view, when u go back to where you left off browsing, it does not take you back to where u left off, it takes you back to the beginning of the page and resorts all the items..so you literally have to re-scroll through all the items.",1
2023,"Worst app I've used in a long time. Prevalent issues with being returned to the top of a list while browsing, hitting the back button after examining an item to be returned to the top of the list and pages simply not loading. This level of poor performance is unacceptable, especially for such a large company that's been around for so long - since the 90's",1
2022,"I used to love this App but unfortunately, it doesn't function properly anymore. Pages need forever to load. Most of the time I get the info that something went wrong, or it won't let me access ""browse by departments"", and the ""my favorite"" feature is not working anymore for over 3 months. I tried to open a tech ticket with customer support but this doesn't seem to be an option. They just told me to use the browser instead of the app.",1
2023,"Glitches I'm the system! Takes forever for the app to come up so you can even sign in or pay your bill. Also if you go back, it starts from the beginning of your search. Have to keep putting in the filters to kinda sorta find what you want to look at. Also super bucks are a nice thought but you must purchase a high dollar amount to use them and wait for months to be able to use them. Not a system glitch but something maybe to look at also.",2
2023,"There is such a problem with this app, and many pages, not loading all of the time. It's been an issue for manyyy months. I might as well get on the Old Navy website using a browser. Old Navy, please please please support your android mobile app developers and give them the resources to actually improve this app functionally. Preferably, before you decide to completely change the UI/UX. While I'm at it, nobody wants to hit the back button and the previous page changes entirely.",2
2023,"Nice looking interface with intuitive design, but I have a couple bones to pick with this app. First, When backing out of an item, it should pick up where you left off on the browsing page. Instead it brings you back up to the top of your page. In addition to that, filters don't always work. Using a Pixel 6.",3
2023,"This app has a couple major glitches. One is when you put in filters it doesn't filter accordingly. And, secondly, my biggest complaint, when you scroll down through a bunch of items, click on one to view it, go back to main page, it takes you to the top again instead of the spot you were at! Super frustrating!",3
2021,"This version of the app is horrible. The titles don't show information that you need, the filtering is so basic that you end up with more things than you want, when you view an item and go back it returns you to the top of the search results which have more things in it than you want in the first place. Absolutely not an upgrade from the previous app. Horrible to use.",1
2022,"This is so frustrating. For days I've tried to check out with a fairly substantial purchase and the app will fail and not allow me to check out because ""Something went wrong"". Well please do tell what it is that went wrong! I have the updated version, I've cleared memory and cache, I've installed and re-installed, I've tried using Wi-Fi instead. Based on the number of reviews with this issue or the login issue, logic would dictate the app needs a major overhaul.",2
2022,"I don't think i have ever rated an app poorly before, but this one...oof. This app sucks. It is buggy, slow, and constantly has errors. Won't let you add things to your cart without an error. always have to log in multiple times when i am trying to shop. it lags like a mofo. it's difficult to search. it's so graphics and image heavy that it takes forever to load products. Their website is no better, i have similar issues there... please get a grip, Gap inc., and figure out how to fix it.",1
2022,"I have never experienced a more annoying awful app than this one. it's slow and logs you out every 10 minutes while you're browsing. the interface is so thrown together and not intuitive. I would say I'll just go back to online shopping from the website but when I do, I'm constantly bombarded with pop ups of downloading their app. lose/lose never shopping here again",1
2023,"Love the idea of being able to use Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, or Athleta, but the app hardly ever works. It stalls often, doesn't load the items most of the time, signs out in the middle of processing, and isn't organized well to see all the colors of the clothes. I think I've only successfully been able to use it once or twice.",2
2022,"This review is a reflection of the app experience not the brand itself, the app is still having issues even after the latest update. While scroll browsing, making a selection and then backing out, the point of return is not saved, either snapping father back or forward, and potentially rearranging items. Also while applying promos, the save button grays out, forcing a back out, leading to uncertainty if the promos or codes are applied until checkout. TBC.",3
2021,I love the app and it is easy to shop across all their brands. I love that you are able to scan the bar codes while at the store to see if you can order a size that they don't have or see what other colors an item comes in. I don't know if it's just my app but I do have issues at times with being able to see my orders and have to use my internet browser to view them. The app is a lot easier to navigate than the old one too.,4
2021,"The App buffers and gets stuck a lot, but works good when none of those issues are going on. The ads/deals are rough to understand though since they're literally all over the place when you open the app. It makes it really hard to see what deals are going on, and which ones I want to see. I still use the app all the time though!",3
2021,"Downgrade! I'm trying to use my rewards but I keep getting an error when trying to upload my card info. I can not scan or manually type in. Simple things function worse as well...I am looking through a list of 200+ items get half way through and see something I like. When I click on it and try to go back to list, it jumps back to beginning.",2
2023,"This app never works on my Android- Samsung Galaxy S8. I can open the app but as soon as I click on something, it never loads. All I get is the something went wrong message. And then I can't shop! If it loads when you are shopping for an item in multiple colors, every time you choose a different color option you have to wait for the image to scroll throuhg all options to finally show the one you selected. It's ridiculous! All other apps work fine, except ON.",1
2022,"I was glad to see that Old Navy had an app, as the website tends to be pretty slow. Somehow, the app is so, so much worse. It's so slow, pages won't open, I can switch from one tab to another and I suddenly have to sign in again. I love Old Navy, but I'll continue using the website and using it infrequently since it's such a slow hassle",2
2023,"This app is terrible, even with an update. If I'm scrolling, it automatically puts me to the top of the page. I spend more time waiting for it to load, or refresh than I do shopping! They keep defaulting my address to one I had 10 years ago and when checking out just now, I miraculously had extra items in my cart when they weren't there 5 minutes ago.",1
2021,"Liked the old version better! When you go from a single item back to the full list it starts you back at the top - too much scrolling to get back to where you were. At checkout had to drill down to see shipping (defaulted to the $7 standard instead of the perferred free - the note at the bottom said the extra time was appreciated). Also, it took multiple tries to get the promo codes and rewards for Signature card holders to work. Finally, really mad that screenshots are not allowed in app=dumb!",2
2022,"This app is really bad the load time is always very slow even though no other apps are experiencing lag. I mean it is every time. Also, they say I can get free shipping if I order over $50. Each time I have tried to purchase a $50+ purchase through the app it still tries to charge shipping at the end even though it show it should be free. I always end up having to log in on the computer to complete the purchase for free shipping. Kinda defeats the purpose of having the app.",1
2021,"Anyone else hate this ""new and approved"" app I can not get on to pay my bill at all. I have to switch it to full site in order for everything to appear or I get an error message stating to go back and try again. Either they don't want anyone to pay their credit card bills or want people to move forward to paying and it freeze so one thinks let me try again and low and behold the company tricked the customer and more funds than expected is out of your bank account. Horrible!",1
2021,"Nice direction with the update, but some improvements are obviously needed. Looking forward to upcoming releases with bug fixes. But, as always, Old Navy kills it when it comes to jumping between brands. Also, seems like instead of a forced update, I now have two instances of the app...old and new. Update/replace is preferred, especially when the old persists with a update suggestion.",2
2021,I like that the app is up to date as far as inventory is concerned. I get to know before checkout if the item has sold or not. Other apps cannot be refreshed until you get into shipping details. At times coupon codes + sales have shoppers buying multiples in some popular garments. It is helpful to have this feature. My dislike is the default to charged shipping. Why not default to basic free no rush shipping? Why default to $7 ship? I LOVE being a credit card holder. Very good reward program.,5
2021,"This is really a downgrade! I hate everything about it. Can't find discounts, it reverted back to old info on my address going back years! Had to reset password, can't browse or click on anything without going back to the beginning every time! It's so annoying! Were they high when they so called improved this?? It really sucks so much. You are going to loose customers.",1
2022,"This app is inconsistent and just downright glitchy. It constantly makes me sign in over and over. I enabled the fingerprint option to avoid this but it never, ever pops up/gives me the option. It barely refreshes. Once I'm ready to make a purchase, it becomes very glitchy, and keeps telling me something went wrong, so I always have to go and use the browser. The only thing this app is good for is looking at merchandise. Even that is glitchy.",2
2022,"The old app with the navy colored logo was much better and more functional. I never had issues with the old app, but since I got updated to this new app with the red logo, I can't even browse as the app kicks me out when looking at things. I have just selected an item to view details and the app brings me back to the sign-in page with a message saying that there was no activity for a while, so I have to sign-in again. Not even 30 seconds has elapsed since I clicked on the item. Useless app.",1
2022,"Won't let me checkout, keeps on showing a ""Something went wrong"" for the past few days. The discount I want to use only applies for orders in the app otherwise I would use the website. Also never saves my filters after I've clicked on a product and want to go back to my search. So frustrating. If this isn't resolved I won't be purchasing anything from them soon.",2
2022,"Constant issues. I get alerts from the app but when I click on it the app opens and doesn't load. If I go to the home screen and select a category it takes me to a blank page that is stuck loading. There are updates for the app almost daily and even when I update, it still doesn't work. This app is useless.",1
2022,"Good grief, please fix the issues already. Constantly logs you out. Requires typing password to log back in despite having biometrics turned on (app switches it off randomly). Can't complete purchases. Old Navy- you just lost money because I am tired of trying to complete purchases in the app only to move to website to complete the purchase. I shouldn't have to jump through so many hoops to complete a purchase.",1
2022,"Have found some great deals over the years. Sometimes it's a case of you get what you pay for especially in the T-Shirt departments. All in all I am satisfied. My one issue is working the checkout process when there is Coupon Cash involved. Had to call Customer Service twice, because their system was acting up. They had sent me an email that I had a nice amount of Coupon Cash accumulated which I could use on anything. It was not an easy task to be able to apply this coupon cash.",3
2021,"Awful app, especially compared to the older version. As always, they never have anything in stock or it takes forever to receive anymore. There services have definitely gone downhill. Deleted app since it only force closes, especially during high traffic times. Slowly they haven't my business. Hope it is corrected eventually for those who use their apps, services, and for purchasing items.",1
2022,"I LOVE Old Navy, but definitely not the unbelievably poor performance of this app. I live far from any Old Navy stores and usually order online, so I decided to download the app! Right off the bat, everything became glitchy, load times were up, and screen rendering was extensive, leading to me giving up on my orders, which I was sad about. Back-end servers could be more thoroughly evaluated, & addressing the data would probably benefit the front-end servers for a more user friendly experience.",1
2023,"I'm pleased with Old Navy itself. Their clothes are decent, and their return policy is excellent, which comes in handy being so indecisive. However, the app is another story. When I open the app, it takes forever to load no matter what I do, and my favorites never show up. This time, I'm caught in a continuous loop of being promted to update the app. Finally, I just uninstalled it. I'm going to reinstall and try again. Hopefully, that helps. Old Navy really needs to fix their app.",3
2022,"I love old navy, but the app SUCKS I do most of my shopping on the app but it barely works for me. Pages don't load or take forever to load. It used to work fine for me about 6 months ago. Now it just takes up space on my phone. Sometimes reinstalling fixes it but it's for a very short time. The desktop site works, fine. Just use that instead.",1
2023,"The app is practically unusable. You're better off using the website or going in person at this point. Every time you click on an item, when you back out of the item, you get sent back to the very beginning of the list of items and the order changes up. So frustrating because you'll have scrolled past 100 items only to have to start from the beginning, and you don't know what items you have or haven't looked at already because the order changed.",1
2021,"You know, I didn't think there was any possible way you could make a bigger pos app than the original ON app, but son of a bee sting, you've done it. The app crashes upon opening every single time and is unusable (which is not desirable, in case you weren't aware). In a world where the majority of people shop almost exclusively online, this level of incompetence is absolutely baffling. Keep up the good work! ??",1
2022,"I love the Old Navy app! It has always been an easy, convenient way to shop. But since last week, nothing works! When I try to remove an item from my cart, it takes me back to sign-in over and over. It gives an option to ""Refresh"", but it doesn't do anything. It won't let me edit my cart, therefore I can't make a purchase. I've cleared cache and checked for new updates.",1
2021,"The only persistent issue I have with the app is rather tedious. When I click to view an item then click to return to the previous page of items to continue scrolling through ON inventory, the page refreshes and returns to the top of the list. This becomes tedious after some time scrolling through product and having to scroll even more just to return to where I left off in my scrolling. Maybe some kind of coding revision can fix this issue?",3
2022,"Glitchy, takes forever to load anything (on wifi or 5G), I constantly have to sign in (even with trying to enable biometric log in), and the display/sorting is annoying. I don't want to see a list of every color an item comes in when browsing, I want to see that when I click on it. Streamline the visual.",1
2021,"I like the convenience of the app but it's super glitchy. I can never look at my points or rewards on it. I always have to go to the website instead because it just keeps ""loading"". Same thing with looking at my credit card status. If I could seamlessly handle everything through the app I would like it more.",2
2022,"Horrible app! Allows me to make my selections, however the minute I try to check out, it gives an error message ""Something Went Wrong"". This happens every time. I've tried reinstalling, refreshing, etc...I'm done trying. You've lost so many of my sales, I do not live near an Old Navy, moving on to other online stores.",1
2022,"The update done on this app has made it really difficult to use. It will repeatedly prompt you to log in every few times you add something to your cart and every time you try and move aomrthing to ""save for later"". It has gotten so frustrating it has actually stopped me from purchasing on more than one occasion.",2
2021,"Not as user friendly as just using website. I found that the 'filter by' feature when trying to narrow search options is not very helpful....difficult to really narrow down to a specific search. Also during checkout, trying to figure out how to add promo codes and change payment features was difficult. Just downloaded the app and will probably just go back to the website.",2
2022,"I have never written a review for an app but my experience with the Old Navy app has been so bad, for so long that I'm finally over it and felt the need to share my experience. When I can actually get the app to open, I often get a message stating ""oops, something went wrong"", I have to log in every single time I use the app, and when I'm viewing an item and go back to the main list of items, it just takes me back to the beginning of the list, making it impossible to view a large number of items",1
2021,"Needs work. The older app was more user friendly. The checkout bag glitches and says opps. Can't even see what I've saved. When filtering you can't do as much as with the older app, and if you back up a page from adding to your bag it'll send you straight to the top of the list. Kinda sad coming from such a large company.",1
2023,"This app is simply the worst. It constantly gives me a message that something went wrong, so I am restarting it several times every time I use it. When I do get it to work correctly, when I am scrolling down a category looking at items and I click on one, when I back out of the item it takes me to the beginning of the list. If I was 150 items down I have to start over because I clicked on an item. I do a lot of online shopping and this app is definitely one of the worst.",1
2023,"This is month 2 , and there has been an error message for when I try to pay my old navy credit card.. last month, it did the same thing as I was charged a late fee? Because of a faulty app. Thus month the same thing is happening. There's an error message, and it will not let me pay my bill?? I have called, and the help line is ZERO help. Told me it was a service issue, and there was nothing they could do? They didn't even drop the late fee when it wasn't my issue. It was obviously the websites?",1
2023,"Sales render most items out of stock on a regular basis. Also, color options should be added per individual item instead of listing the same item in each available shade as separate items. That's just a waste of time, space, and effort, please stop doing this fam.",2
2023,"Just downloaded this to give it a shot after being prompted on their website- not worth even the 5 minutes I spent trying to make it work. It crashed every time I tried to open the ""log in"" page to access my account. Absolute trash app. It's better to stick to the browser site.",1
2023,"Terrible app. I log in most probably daily and it the all never fails to freeze up while I'm on it. By now I would think ON would be able to have someone fix all of these bugs in their app. I wish I could get on and browse without all of the freezes. Sometimes I just log off due to it causing me not to even bother purchasing anything. PLEASE fix all the ""bugs"" in this app!",1
2023,they seem like they are trying to fix the site issues. biggest problem I have with old navy is sizing...it's okay at best. really shooting in the dark sometimes when making a choice for size. other than that...i really like their deals and clothes. decent price. Quality lacks in some areas though.,4
2023,"This app is so slow and buggy. When at store, it takes forever to even have the app to start or work after scanning a product. When you want to remove something from your cart, it gets buggy, and the item can't be removed. Had to go on the website to remove an item from my cart. Categories took FOREVER to load.",2
2023,"This app takes me back to my childhood...I grew up using dial-up internet. It's slow. Painfully slow. Like I can't shop here slow. Sure, dial-up was amazing when I was a kid. But when we know better, we do better, Old Navy! And don't give me that is not me It's you speech. All my other apps are high speed af. They say you aren't even trying. They say you've given up. I'm not ready to quit you yet... but you're on notice. Hugs and kisses!!",1
2023,"I used to love this app. Made all my payments on time. BUT, I went shopping at the actual store and my card was declined. Came to find out, I had a bill that I knew nothing about. On this app, it says 0 balance, when in reality I had a bill over a $100 something that I haven't been paying since June. Don't know why it says 0 balance on here!?!?!? Y'all messed up my paying on time streak!! So disappointing!!",1
2023,"App is always slow to load or doesn't load at all at times. If you click on something and then go back to the previous page it puts everything out of order and brings you back to the top, so you get a mix of things you've already seen and things you haven't.",2
2023,This app never works. The website is just as bad. Even the stores have terrible connections. I waited 10 minutes for their system to load just for them to say i was picking up an order. They need a new system all around.,1
2023,App lags terribly... i hate how the categories aren't more organized. You are going through 100s of items and seriously I get tired of scrolling and waiting for it to load... its soo slow. I usually never buy what I did see I wanted and close out. I rarely use my C. Card here. Its more a hassel then anything.,1
2023,"It never works. It takes a long time to load and when it finally does load, I get ""oops something went wrong."" Everytime there's an update, I hope for a fix, but it gets worse!",1
2023,"Rip off artists. Scammed me twice on clothing. Used earned discounts, but clothes never came, they told me a refund would take 30 days, and then to re-order, except the clothes are now out of stock! They said to pay without discounts, then then discount refund would take another 2 WEEKS!!! New mom, can't afford this. ZERO STARS!!!! DON'T ENABLE THIS SCAM OF A COMPANY!!!!!!!!! AMAZON IS BETTER!!!",1
2023,"One reason I love Old Navy is because I've been buying from them for so long, that I know exactly what size I wear. But more importantly, are the reviews. I always read them, and there such a help. I won't purchase anything without reading the reviews first.",5
2023,"app crashes a lot and causes my phone to overheat. when the app is reopened, everything I had in my cart is gone and I have to start over.",2
2023,"Creating an account doesn't work at all. Also, the app looks all backwards on phones that are set to work in a right to left language, such as Arabic or Hebrew.",1
2023,"I concur with the previous reviews. The app is HORRIBLE. I have encountered all the same issues. The items shipped from the store and availability is great for the most part and the selection for Tall sizes is excellent. Be aware though, that in your Account - My Orders - Order Details - in the Summ of Chrgs that the ""Order Total"" does not include your S & H even though it appears it does. Add your S & H to the Order Total for the actual withdrawal/chg to your account/card. Really misleading.",1
2023,"I dont know about anyone else, but this horrible app has kept me from buying from old navy. Im.never able to just browse. when you go into the store they rarely have items you're looking for.. the app was my go to.. its been months since I've been able to purchase. Very, very disappointing and frustrating.",1
2023,"Frustrating! The app logs you out anytime you click to view an item, it takes a long time to load then just times you out. Constantly having to log back in.",1
2023,"App crashes at sign-in or check out. Wasted 30 minutes adding things to my bag, but I can't buy anything.",1
2023,Constantly Glitching. I was hoping the update would've helped hut its just the same. This issue makes it IMPOSSIBLE to filter items and actually look through them. Click in one things and go back and the filters are gone. Horrible app.,1
2023,"Slow to process, crashes unexpectedly. Also, after clicking on an item to view, if you hit the back button you will be directed to the top of the page and not pick up where you left off in your shopping. Checkout is typically smooth however.",2
2023,"This app never works. It loads, and nothing is happening. just jumps to the beginning of the page. A total waste of time and phone space. I wonder how this app has over 4 stars with every person giving 1 to 2 stars!? Who alters these reviews but can't fix the app.",1
2023,"The app is working much better now. Still a little glitchy at times, but nothing like it was. Works great most of the time.",4
2023,"App is trash. Rarely works. ""Something went wrong..."" message constantly. Crashes, screens won't load, can see offers.",1
2023,the deals are great for 1st time buyers online. and look interesting for the most part. but the app is slow and lags sorta sucks. but I'm a buyer,3
2023,The app has some glitches and bugs that can be worked on. Sometimes it's easier to order from a browser. Sometimes!,4
2023,"Not working properly. For example, I hit a link for jeans... It always says ""oops, something went wrong"" it does that with every category.",1
2023,"Awesome!! Prices vary, but when your on a budget you get what you pay for and depending on what you need and how you take care of your products/clothes they do last !! Thank you Old Navy...",5
2023,Slightly above K-mart (did I actually sat that yes I did not that I ever really stopped Kmart. Old Navy serves America's middle class enabling them to have at least fighting chance of being stylish on a budget. I've done it!,1

2023,The application is glitchy when I switch between categories and will not load. Sometimes I have the close out of the application and reload to get to another shopping category,4
2023,"Annoying. I like that you can customize and filter items to narrow your search, but it doesn't even matter because it's still flawed. I'll scroll through 100 items and click on one, but when I go back to my main search list, it will automatically scroll back all the way to the top of the list. Nobody has time for that.",2
2023,"the kids clothes are stylish, hold up well, and reasonable. when there's a sale it's always worth checking it out. i buy things for the whole family and as gifts. participate in the rewards it's worth it. Overall it is a great place to shop. Thank you",5
2023,"This app has become THE WORST shopping experience. For quite some time, I have been unable to use it properly. It glitches, won't allow sign ins, and payments are terrible. I can barely use it. I've mostly had to login on my browser to shop and pay. At this point that app is useless. What happened?!",1
2023,"Awful, horrible, worst app ever. Won't load anything. Signs me out constantly. Tried everything to fix it but nothing has worked. Going to uninstall and reinstall.

2023,"Put simply: the app sucks. More often than not it glitches, it lags, it doesn't load, or it times out and force quits on its own. It constantly requires you to log in, and even then, it's a hassle to sign in. You would think that Gap Inc. would get with the times and invest in a better user friendly app, but apparently not. Still waiting to see when some of these updates will be useful.....if at all.",1
2023,"It's really baffling to me that a bigger name has such a poor app. Problems like, not loading anything, error pages, randomly kicking me out of the app, never saving my place when you scroll after looking at an item, and constantly logging me out. Most of the time I don't even bother trying the app because I know it's so reliably bad. I love Old Navy's clothes, but between our local store downsizing massively and the unshoppable app it's hard to not pass it over and shop somewhere else.",1
2023,"Great clothes, terrible app: I have never shopped on the app without an issue. Not once. There is always a glitch or the app shuts down randomly. It ALWAYS logs me out and forces me to reenter my credentials. I am so tired of seeing, ""something went wrong"" I can honestly say that I would shop at Old Navy way more if this app worked properly. It's a pain in the butt to get out my laptop everytime I want to browse a sale.",2

2023,"I'm not sure what's going on with the app for the past few days, but I haven't been able to open it at all. I've tried uninstalling it to see if that fixes it, and that didn't help. I completely restarted my phone, thinking it might be on my end, and that didn't help either. Prime time shopping opportunities missed.",1
2023,There's a new issue everytime I open this app. They constantly push updates for this app but it still never works completely. I can no longer see if a particular item is available in a store near me.,1
2023,I love old navy but the shopping catalog often never loads or takes forever. Sure has helped to cut back my spending though!,2
2023,I reeeaaally wish this app would work better. I haven't been able to pay my CC bill through the app in months so I have to use my computer. Not the biggest deal in the world but it's far less convenient than my phone.,1
2023,"Always have a difficult time accessing the app. It never loads, and I have to exit out the apps multiple times for it and finally load the page. Hopefully, they will fix it soon!",1
2023,I can't even scroll through a page without it taking back to the beginning of the page and when I open an item and go to close it it takes me back to the top of the page and I have to start all over and have to find where I left off on the page before I opened the item I was looking at. I miss the old app that atleast worked. Please fix this app.,2
2023,This app is a waste of storage it does not work. Nothing never loads on this app. I always have to go online to the website so reality there is no purpose for this app. Which why I will be deleting it. The new updates are suppose to fix the issues but nothing never ever changes.,1
2023,"App is getting worse with each update. Runs slow, glitchy and you can never pay your bill easily. Always an ""Unexpected error has occurred "". Dropped my old 5 star rating from 2021 down to 1 star.",1
2023,"I love Old Navy, and I used to love shopping through their app, but I hardly spend money there anymore because every time I long onto the app it says ""Something Went Wrong,"" and will not let me look at anything. It has been MONTHS of this, and I really just wish I could use the app again.",1
2023,"App makes me login multiple times and still will not actually login. I have LOTS of issues trying to access my credit card to make payments, which is extremely frustrating. App overall is very glitchy.",1
2023,All the store franchises under one umbrella and it's as easy to navigate and buy the things I want.,4
2023,"This is, hands down, the slowest and glitchiest app I've ever used. 90% of the time the page doesn't load. It just spins till I lose my patience. Maybe it's fate telling me not to spend money. All I know is they could have made a lot more money from me if their platform actually worked.",1
2023,"Website is garbage. Removes items from your cart within 10 minutes. Constantly messages you to check out, the sorting doesn't work only ordered one time tried several times. Don't waste your time or money. Shop anywhere else.",1
2023,"I used to buy from this site often. but the last 8 months the application can not be used. after viewing the product, the page returns to the very beginning of the category. have to scroll over and over again. Developers, please fix this.",1
2023,"Always find what I love. Most importantly the prices on kids clothes is amazing. Especially, since they grow like weeds. hehe",5
2023,"I wish you all would stock more when you know something is going to sell quick. Like no, I don't want an ugly cropped tshirt. I want an oversized button down. Why in the hell are you all not ordering a lot of them? They go way too fast for it to be you all actually ordering plenty.",1
2023,"Love the store but the app is absolutely terrible. Half the time it doesn't load certain screens, and the other half the time it crashes.",1
2023,"This app freaking sucks. You would think that after many years of being around yall could at least get this right. So many updates for what. To make things worst every time i try to make a payment it'll ask for answers for questions i didn't even set up, looks like they're trying hard to make you miss payments. All about the extra fees! Smh beyond disappointed, and the reviews speak for themselves!!!!",1
2023,"I love old navy clothing but the app is almost always broken. It always stalls, won't load or even sends you back to the top when you're scrolling. Plus the login feature legit never works. When I finally get logged in it logs me right back out",2

2023,I love the styles and the prices are great but the app is so slow and glitches way too much.,4

2023,"This app is so dang glitchy. I just cannot with it anymore. It's impossible to make credit card payments unless I just call in and the rewards aren't as good as they used to be anyway. Not worth it. See ya later, Old Navy.",1
2023,"Pretty good app. It does freeze on occasion, which can be annoying.",4
2023,Old Navy really raised the bar in the quality of their clothes and other products. Love ?,5
2023,"Worst shopping experience ever. App takes forever to load, nothing stays saved on your basket or in your favorite, infinite scrolling because it just brings you right back to the very first item... like the brand despise the app.",1
2023,"App Never Works. The idea of an app for shopping at these stores is great, but every time I have tried to use it the past year, I am unable. That is beyond a glitch. Just start over, Old Navy. There is no excuse for such a big company to have an amateur app.",1

2023,"I love Old Navy. I'm a plus size person and they have the softest, best fitting pajamas, tank tops, shirts, and pants that I have found anywhere. The only bad thing is that the plus sizes sell out quickly. The app is really fast and efficient and I love it.",5
2023,"This app crashes ALL the time and it's so frustrating. I want to spend money in your business and you're making it so complicated to buy online. Thanks to your poor app, Amazon and Target are getting my money.",1
2023,App is fine. Would be better if it didn't glitch so much.,4
2023,"Whenever I open the app, it rarely ever loads and is extremely slow. If I click on a clothing item and go back to the previous page it takes me all the way to the top again.",1

2023,"It's nice. But the main problem I have with it is that it always logs me out. Also, whenever I try to do my shopping, its always on the loading screen. I'd much rather just shop on my laptop using the website. Don't download this app, just use the website.",3
2023,"I like old navy, bt the app sucks. glitches. doesn't take you back where you left off after adding to cart. When I am scrolling thebscreen will jump me back to the top and I have to keep doing it over and over.",2
2022,"I usually use the desktop version to purchase items but decided to try the app for convenience. At first it worked great. I was browsing and ablr to put items into my cart but when I went to review my item, it gave me an error and refresh. Hit refresh multiple times, nothing.

2023,This app freezes constantly. Try to open it after a notification and freezes if you try to click anything like 80% of the time.,1

2023,Constantly crashing. I cant order anything off of the app. I can only place orders on a computer. I have a Galaxy S22 and should not be experiencing this issue.,1

2023,"The app isn't working properly most of time, you just get stuck at loading page. Very frustrated when you want to shop but the app isn't working.",1
2023,"Worst app ever. It never works. I've done every single update hoping that it would fix the problem, no such luck. Old Navy should get out of the app business. I promise no one will miss it.",1
2023,"Old Navy offers value-priced fashions for all members of my family in a full range of sizes. I'm a petite, our son is tall & slender, and our daughter needs size 3XL. From my young teen to this senior mom, there is always something cute and trendy for all of us.",5

2023,I can only open the app through Google play I can't even open it through the app and password reset takes forever...if I could rate this it wouldn't even get a star I wrote this post 2 years ago and nothing has changed the only update is the slow password recovery,1

2023,This app has been so slow and now it keeps saying an error has occurred. I need to be able to get on it so I can pay my bill. Fix the app please,2
2023,Nope. This app is awful. I seriously have had to go onto my browser and shop Old Navy that way because the app is basically non functional most of the time.,1
2023,Must sign in repeatedly before it works. Takes forever to load...tedious and slow. I may as well send it via snail mail.,1
2023,This app is so slow and archaic. The page of clothes I'm looking at randomly send me back to the top and it's so frustrating.,1

2022,"When it works, it's great! But I've never had it easy with this app. My biggst complaint is that the content rarely ever even loads! That's on top of constantly having to re-sign in when adding items to cart, wonky sized product titles(nbd), and major lag when trying to view a single product.",2
2022,Updated app is useless. You can't even open it to pay your bill. Its opened 1x in past 2 months & only went as far as asking what store I was trying to manage my bill & wouldn't go any further. Other times it always says incorrect username or password even though I have it right in front of my face because I keep all my username & passwords wrote down in a specific notebook. I wouldn't doubt it's because they want you to pay late so they can get extra money for a late fees. I have to call to pay,1

2022,"I love Old Navys clothes but the app is horrible!!! It's constantly making you log back in, it never loads, always says ""something went wrong"", & they are always advertising things that are out of stock, as soon as you click on the picture it pulls up something similar or tells you it's out of stock. I know they can do better. Poorly ran app. I always just use the internet browser to order, but the website in general has issues too.",1
2022,"App for Android needs a lot of work. When clicking on any category, you must refresh and go back once, and then click on again. Otherwise it just keeps loading and loading or an error pops up. I constantly have to close the app and reload it, otherwise it ""logs me out"", even though upon reloading I am still logged in. I would prefer the website but even that is buggy and slow. app is used on a Google pixel 6.",3
2022,"This app is terrible right now! It makes you re-login every 5 seconds, or at least every time you try to open a new product to look at. Can't browse without logging in. Seems like overkill.

Then finally get the option to set up payment, and keep getting told the date format is wrong when I select it straight from the drop down calendar. Does Old Navy not want my credit card payment this month? It shouldnt be this difficult to give them my money! Ridiculous.",1
2021,"I have had this app for years. I've ALWAYS been able to pay on my credit card thru it. They've now taken away that option. NOW you call them on the phone and it's not free to make a payment. In order to make a payment you have to go into their web site, log in, and then you can make a payment for free... Stupid is what I call this! It's NOT convenient to leave the app, go onto chrome, type in their website, and THEN log into your account. At that point you're able to make a payment. Change it !",1
2023,"Regularly crashes, errors when trying to pay card, pages don't load. It's nearly unusable at times",2
2023,"Super buggy, now to the point of being almost completely unusable. The pages rarely load. Sometimes when they do, they reload randomly. It's easier to just use the website, though that has problems, too, no matter what device I access it from.",1

2023,"Simply doesn't work. If the categories or search actually loads, the app crashes. If not, you're left staring at loading screens. I thought it was a hardware issue at first but the experience is the same on new phones. App is just too heavy for its own good.",2
2022,"This app has always been clunky and annoying but I could handle logging in every time I used it. Now, I have to log in literally 10 times through the shopping process to even buy something? It's so annoying and makes me think twice and not even bother buying anything. Be like Target. It's 2022, you can leave me logged into the app all the time ??",1

2023,POS app. Constant errors when searching and filtering. Takes forever to load.,1
2023,I've given up shopping at Old Navy through the app. I can never get it to work. I used to buy most of my kids clothes from Old Navy,1
2023,"Love ON, but NOT the app!! Even if I have full signal strength or use wi-fi, it takes forever to load...and that's if I don't close it after 10 minutes of waiting! Super glitchy app that needs a new company to develop and troubleshoot their tech!",1
2023,"Always has bugs. It's always closing out or frozen. I love shopping at old navy, but since most of my shopping is done online I haven't been able to shop at old navy as much because of how poor the app is.

2023,"Repeated issues with this app. Every time I log into the app, it tells me to update, even if I have done so recently. It also doesn't load pages or randomly logs me out. I have uninstalled and reinstalled so many times and the problems continue.",1
2023,"Randomly closes, but more irritating is that looking through 1200 items and after looking at something specific, it goes back to the top. I don't want to start over and I'll never get past the first few things I look at because I'm not scrolling all day to get back to where I was.",3
2023,"Just uninstalled the app. I'll just use my web browser. Takes forever to load the home screen and when it shows up and I click on women section, it does the loading thing again and takes forever. I don't have time for that. Good riddance!",1
2023,"When I click some items to take a better look, the wrong product populates. I just spent about an hour browsing through the app, adding to My Bag. When I went to check out, it asked me to log in AGAIN. Then I got an error message that the request cannot be completed, and everything from My Bag disappeared. What a waste of time.",1
2022,"After all the updates the app is getting from.bad to worse. I use to love browsing and shopping here but this app is virtually impossible. Takes forever to load, when it doesn't crash before fully opened. Hard to navigate. Really a pain. Saving me money for sure, since I don't spend not even a fraction of what I used to at old navy app anymore .on top of it doesn't let you save any of your login info, making the process even longer. Kind of give up",1
2023,Doesn't Load or work ever. So slow and is always needing to be updated. Same slow situation as before the the update.,1
2021,"Dislike the ""upgrade."" It kept glitching out and saying it couldn't reload when I was going between my saved for later items and my bag. Additionally, it didn't present any option for AfterPay as a payment option if needed as it did before. This ""upgrade"" was a complete downgrade. I liked the previous version much MUCH better.",2
2022,The app isn't perfect but works well enough. the scan in store is frustrating and doesn't provide clear price answers. I also don't like that it'll take you back to the top of the options rather than where you were when you back out of viewing an option,4
2022,"I like Old Navy and I used to really like this app. However, for the past week or so, every time I try to sign into the app, I get a page saying ""something went wrong"" and if I hit ""refresh"" it prompts me to sign in again, then the same thing happens over and over. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and clearing the cache but nothing has worked and the app has been rendered completely useless.",1
2023,love old navy...wish they still included return label w/purchase (like they use to) it was so convenient just to put it on & put back in mailbox,5
2021,"First let me start by saying that the only thing I like about the ""new & improved app"" is that I'm able to see my rewards & my super cash codes. However, nothing else works on the app. I can't add a shipping address, can't add my old navy card for payments & I can add items to my cart, but I can't check out. I always get an error msg that"" something went wrong."" ""We weren't able to complete your request"". ""Refresh to try again""...please fix it.",1
2022,"Terrible app. You have to keep logging in over and over. Sometimes it won't open and just has the loading circle forever. If you are shopping and check your cart, you can't just arrow back to where you left off. It starts you over at the top of the category. It's infuriating to use this app. If it wasn't such a crummy app I would buy a lot more stuff, but I get so irritated and give up.",2
2023,"I love the sales and discounts. But app is terrible keeps saying update, get to Google no update. Keeps logging me out.",1
2023,almost unusable at times. the lag is insane,1
2022,I might shop more if 1. I didn't have to sign in multiple times in the same day (read: session). 2. The categories would load so I could shop & not get frustrated and close the app. 3. I could read all the characters in the checkout (including subtotal) prior to checking out. These are all new post-upgrade glitches that are seemingly being ignored; judging by the number of reviews that mention the same. An app glitch on my last order caused a double order. Inconvenient.,1
2022,"Giving one star because zero stars is not an issue. Unable to sign in on the app. The sign in tab doesn't give the username or password spot to enter my info. I would include a screenshot to show if I could but no place to attach. I was trying to order jeans 40% off that were only being held for a specific time before removed from order so I had to use the website instead of app. This app is useless if I'm unable to sign into my account. In the past, I didn't have any issues. Please fix this!",1
2022,"The app sometimes works, sometimes not. When it works, it's great! It's user friendly, shopping is easy and they often have good sales and offers. When it doesn't work, it's so frustrating that I'd rather not deal with it at all, I get the same error as other reviews when I try to check out. I feel like it's only been happening more recently, I don't recall being this frustrated before, but now it's basically every time I try to shop.",2
2023,02/03/2022--Sooo glitchy ..just keeps closing the second it opens! Even after 3 reinstalls. 12/30/2022-- literally doesn't load anything for a solid 5 mins. I end up using my browser at the end. 09/09/2023-- I'm seeing so many reviews with the same issues! Why is nobody fixing this?,1
2022,The app never loads anything when clicked on. It errors out or keeps spinning. Does not remember the sign in credentials. Have to sign in every time. Time out setting can't be adjusted I guess. I don't remember seeing keep me signed in. Please fix. I regularly shop on old navy and BR because of the seamless integration these 2 brands have. With app being so glitchy it's not worth shopping.,1
2023,easy to navigate extensive inventory,5
2021,"App never works. It will let you open the app, but as soon as you try and click on anything it's says an unexpected error occurred and won't let you view anything. You can browse the homescreen, but if you are trying to use it to shop or browse different categories, you're better off using the actual internet.",1
2023,"It always logs me out, it never loads correctly. If you have been scrolling through a section and you click on an item, every time you go back it takes you to the top of the section again so you have to scroll all the way back down to where you were. It never actually saves the items I heart/like. It's awful",1
2021,"The only place my tween daughter will shop! I just wish, it could be a more ""1 stop shop"". They do well with loungewear, jeans & t's, workout and sleepwear. They have some dressy-ish clothes, but the quality isn't great or the cuts are off (crooked, too loose in the wrong places, etc.). Otherwise, the truly do have everything...including accessories and shoes.",4
2022,"App is terrible and worse every time I use it. Currently I'm unable to update/remove items from the cart. So I cannot checkout with the deals I want, due to unwanted items in my cart. You are losing out on business. The all has also started asking me to login multiple times, even after I've just done so. Very annoying",1
2023,app never loads. It's so poor. I always shop on the website instead of the app. Disappointing.!!,1
2022,"Looks great, lacks functionality. The app doesn't stay logged in, doesn't save my password. The fingerprint login was great and worked for about a week, then disappeared. Search bar sometimes times out or says there's nothing available. I would really like the app to be more smooth so that I can add items to my cart as I think of them (3 kids to clothe). Sometimes I opt to shop Target kid clothes instead because their app is so much more reliable. Help me love this app as much as the clothes!!",2
2023,The older version i never had issues with. Now its always saying error and glitching.,3
2023,"This app used to be slow and glitchy, constantly going down + being unusable, but it's improved a lot lately",4
2023,"This app is garbage. It almost neverworks well enough to buy anything. Which is ridiculous as the sole purpose of the app is to facilitate giving Gap/Old Navy/BR/Athleta money. Half the time it crashes. The search function is pathetic, the filters are woefully inadequate (that is if the app even decides to apply the filter) and honestly shopping is confusing (what is the difference between the main tab and the shopping tab?) Save yourself the grief and just use the clunky mobile site",1
2023,Great clothes. Love the rewards program.,5
2023,"Very bad app. Once you put item in your cart it will not let you delete or push them to save for later. Whoever design it, not even one star deserves it. The company will lose money on online sales because of this. I have uninstalled and installed still didn't work.??????????????",1
2023,"Updated the app and now every time I hit the back button it takes me all the way back to the top instead of bringing me back to where I was, so then I have to scroll all the way back down through everything",2
2023,"The app used to be great and work well, but now it takes so long to load and it is constantly crashing.",1
2023,This app never works correctly even after I make sure to update it. I get so frustrated that I just give up trying to use it.,1
2023,"The worst app. Never functions properly, even after updating repeatedly. Doesn't reflect the availability of items that are available in the browser. Crashes repeatedly. Never stays logged in. Home screen on the app is always blank. Logs you out if you hit the back button.",1
2023,Takes alot of time to upload and at times it just kicks me out of app. It freezes alot.,1
2022,"Serious loading issues. I literally cannot get anything to load besides the page to select men's/women's etc. The app gets worse every time I open it, prior, the app forced me to log in 5 times in 10 minutes, and would prevent me from even looking at an item if it was out of stock at the moment. Additionally, Old Navy's decision to pull plus sizes out of their stores is a huge disappointment. At this rate I won't bother trying to shop with them at all.",1
2023,"Great options, great deals",4
2023,"Eventually, I just uninstalled. The app would almost never load and it when it did, it was slow, laggy, and full of bugs. Everytime I tried shopping on the app, I ended up just using a web browser.",1
2023,I have shopped Old Navy for years. I actually cried when they shut down our local brick and mortar store. So now I use the app.,5
2023,"This app sucks. It doesn't show you your purchase record, and it won't let you make payments.",1
2021,This app now Sucks!! I've been trying for 30 minutes now just to pay my bill and have had to sign in 4 times and put in my info to pay 3 times with a error everytime. I even Un-installed and re-install but it didn't help. I knew there were going to be issues as soon as I tried to open the app and immediately had to go to the Play store to update and I did that last month!! I may have to close my account. Just too much hassle for me to spend my money.,1
2023,"I hope the developers read all these ratings. Everyone seems to be having the same issues with loading and things generally not working in the app. I also did an uninstall/reinstall and still no fix. Biometric option also not saving/working. I love Old Navy and hope they fix it soon, they are losing sales from the app not working again.",2
2022,"Log in issues every time. Every. Single. Time. I try to log in, it tells me it's wrong, I type in something random to get it to tell me it's wrong again, then I type the first thing I typed in, and it tells me it needs to take me to the site to verify. BUT THEN it just spins and spins and spins and never loads the website. I have so much in my cart, just let me log in so I can buy some stuff! So aggravating. Fix this, and I would use this app a lot more.",2
2023,sometimes it's slow but not too often,4
2021,"This app is terrible. I try to go into OldNavy to check my credit balance, make a payment, etc, it always takes me to GAP or Banana Republic. It takes forever just trying to log into my account. I always end up having to go through Google and inputting ""old navy"" into the address bar to log into OLD NAVY. This app is a waste of time. It's just an advertisement of their stores and products.",1
2023,"This app needs some work. Most of the time the main page won't load, when I try to filter things out it doesn't work, when I try to shop for my toddler the page doesn't load and keeps saying refresh. It gets really frustrating. I'm really surprised with this being a big brand that their app isn't better.",2
2023,This is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever downloaded. 96% of the time it doesn't work. It works seamlessly until you get the the page you want to be on then it just buffers and never loads product. I inevitably have to go through the official website and it's not much better.,2
2022,"Downloading and shopping on the app was easy. However, I have been trying to checkout for two errors and keep getting a message saying that something went wrong. This is extremely frustrating because I had super cash that I needed to use by today, but it's not letting me. So I'll have to shop somewhere else.",2
2023,The clothes are not revealing for girls. They're modest and I am so grateful for that. My son adores the fleece sweats and shirts.,5
2022,"Just use the site. 1. Majority of the time the app just spins, never loads, especially when you're trying to check rewards or cart. 2. You have to login constantly. Never saves account or credit card info so you're constantly logging in while navigating the app to shop, buy, checking rewards etc. what's the point of the app, it can save my cart but not password!? ??I'm uninstalling this AGAIN, I end up using the site anyway",1
2023,This app loads so ridiculously slowly that I usually give up before it loads. I also hate that there are a million updates and every update signs you out.,2
2022,"This app is terrible. It's only good to view your account or current orders and order history. I have to constantly sign on even when I have saved my info. Everytime I try to use it to shop it never opens and when it does it says ""something went wrong"". I have to use the browser to do my shopping. Please fix, if not remove it. Its worthless.",1
2021,Improvements are supposed to make it more user-friendly and streamlined not create a bigger mess. I have the app installed but every time I go to open it I automatically get a notice to go download it from the play store. If I want to open the app I have to click the link that directs me to the play store then launch it from there. Not worth the hassle of bothering to have it installed if it's not going to work.,1
2023,Keeps crashing. What is the point?,1
2023,The app has not been working in over a month. I try to log into my account and it keeps giving an error message.,1
2021,"It was not great before, but this app is TERRIBLE since the recent update!!! I can't access my wallet, my rewards, anything about my ON Credit Card account, and what a complete waste of time trying to shop because it takes you back to the top any time you look at the clothing details, then return to the item list.",1
2021,"the app is just as bad as the website, if not worse! it constantly crashes and won't allow me to checkout. it emptied my cart multiple times, and every. single. time. I log in, it tells me to change my password. very frustrating and inconvenient!",1
2021,"This new app literally sucks. Any time you view an item, it takes you back to the top of the page. And right now, I was trying to checkout with a rather big order, and I put all my info in and hit ""next"" to pay, and it says ""uh oh, something went wrong. Please try again"" at least 10 times. Extremely frustrated.",2
2023,Great selection and variety,5
2023,App can be glitchy at times,4
2023,Great clothes and great prices,5
2023,Love Old Navy. Most of my wardrobe is now Old Navy!,5
2023,Great app. No bugs yet ??.,5
2023,Clothes are great quality.,5
2023,wish more plus sizes can be found in stores,4
2022,"I've had this app on and off for years and it has always sucked. It's slow, makes you sign in multiple times while using it, if you view an item and then go back, you start again at the top. It's just a terrible app, and I love old navy and best deals online so please make your app more functional.",1
2022,"Best site to shop for clothes!! Easy exchanges, always can buy Tall sizes!! customer service is always knowledgeable, helpful, and understanding. If flaws or poor quality item ( which I have had once) no questions just returned and money back. Always keep things in my cart and Texts or emails notified of item on sale. Also if you purchase item and it goes on sale...you just call in and they give you credit on acct for price difference.",5
2023,I cannot see my virtual wallet and its been this way for a few weeks now. I'm letting tons of people know to download the ap. Please fix the issue.,3
2022,"Inventory is never accurate. I use several retail stores apps, and none of them are this slow or have items either unavailable, or unavailable for buy online pick up in stores. I've reinstalled and signed out then back in, but the entire experience is the worst.",2
2021,"When scrolling and browsing, if you click an item to look at and go back, it returns you all the way to the beginning. Very annoying. But at least it gives you the ""Like"" option, so I'll just ""Like"" the item and view it in my Favorites.",2
2023,Nothing in the app will load. Even their online website has trouble with it being glitchy and not loading.,2
2021,"Using this app is just as annoying as using the website. It's hard to narrow down searches. What I hate most is having to sign into it. For some reason I think apps should be about convenience so when I have to sign into one every time I use it, I hate it. Since I can't save password I hate it even more. It should be required when you go to buy or access profile. Verification code? Fine. Hate having to remember passwords to apps I hardly use. For this one I just go online where it's stored.",1
2021,The shittest app on earth. Cannot login even after my login id and password are saved and autofilling. It keeps telling me its the wrong password when its not. Locked my account for no reason. They will make it as hard as possible for me to make a payment so that the late fees can pile up. Update your existing app. Dont make me download 100 different apps.,1
2021,App never works. Can access my wallet or pay my bill. When you select an item to look at and go back it takes you to the top of the page and not where you were. Very frustrating to have to scroll through everything again.,1
2021,"I placed an order through the app which is the first one I've placed with Old Navy in years. The order process went fine, but somehow the app deleted my apartment number, so now there are 2 packages floating around with UPS containing an entire winter wardrobe for my kids and no one knows what to do besides cancelling the order, refunding it, and resending it. Not one customer service person has been able to help in any way.",1
2023,"Well...it used to work great. Now you can't even open any of the tabs. All give a ""something went wrong"" error message. What's really frustrating is that when it does work, if you select an item to view the details, you lose your place where you were scrolling, and sends you to the top of the page every time. It's very annoying.",2
2022,"FIX YOUR APP PLEASE. It is so hard to use due to glitches and it constantly logging me out of my account. Pages take a long time to load even when I'm on a strong internet/wifi connection, my cart has glitched out requiring me to restart the app, and last time I tried to make a purchase in app it just told me ""something went wrong"" and it couldn't continue with the purchase. Restarting the app, logging in and out, and deleting and redownloading didn't help. PLEASE fix your app",1
2021,I don't know what they change but it was on July 15 2021 and the app was working perfect. I went in the next day July 16 2021. I click on the app a screen came up and said the app has stopped working. I tried the other apps the Gap app the same thing happened. I cleared cache I cleared all the cookies started my phone and it's still the same issues I don't know what you changed but change it back. right now I'm going to the website through Chrome that is my only other option.,1
2023,easy to shop and check out!!,4
2022,"app was okay until the latest update and now I can't view my shopping cart or even add anything to it. every time I try to it asks me to sign in, I sign in, it says ""something went wrong"" and offers a ""refresh"" button to try to fix the error ... and nothing happens. I straight up cannot shop this app anymore because it won't let me add items to my cart or view the cart. completely useless.",1
2021,"Having a hard time with this app. Cant even use my rewards. Whenever you click on an item while browsing, then go back to browsing, it takes you all the way to where you started. So annoying that it doesn't go back to where you last were like the previous app.",1
2023,Quality and cute clothes at GREAT prices..mahalo!,5
2021,"Had an order with Super Cash go through- two days later, it got cancelled without warning. I had to email to find out none of the things I ordered were in stock. The app and website said they were available. Customer service was awful and they only offered me 10% off my next order, and when I asked about the Super Cash I had used, they completely blew me off. If you're gonna have an app for people to shop on, try updating the stock once in a while. I'll never shop through this app again.",1
2022,"we really like the app, seems pretty easy to use and like how you can change stores. There are a couple problems 1 is the login screen doesn't show up properly, have to login blindly assume the enter takes you to password entry. 2 is product description and pictures jump around sometimes.",4
2023,It genuinely doesn't even try to work. The best I can do is log in. Then nothing. Pictures don't even come up.,1
2023,I've been able to place 2 successful orders on the app in the year that I've had it. Now i can't get a single page to load to even think about adding stuff to my cart. Its a huge waste of time. You're better off going to the store or using your web browser to look at their website.,1
2022,"Love the products, but the app itself is extremely inconvenient. Constantly logging me out is the least of my worries; it's the fact that it doesn't save my favorites, the home page never loads, and it's always glitching when I'm switching between images.",1
2023,App not working correctly it will not open always says refresh. This has been an outgoing problem.,1
2021,"OOPS! Something went wrong with this App! This isn't funny when your email directs to your App that never works. If you don't know how to build an app, try going back to retail..Every search, menu change, or click is broken and crashes the app. OOPS, isn't funny when it repeats at every page change.",1
2023,"I think the app could be good, but every time I click on a notification that alerts me to a deal, it never opens the deal and then I can't find said deal in the app. It also reloads quite frequently, which is frustrating when you are pagea into searching for something.",3
2021,"This app is terrible, features never work half the time, and besides just the app, online shopping with Old Navy is always a headache and not at all worth it anymore. I've finally used up all my credit card rewards (and every online purchase using them was a hassle with multiple customer service calls-- plus a toss up on whether or not the CS rep would be helpful or a jerk-- since the app was constantly not functioning), so I'm done using the credit card and done shopping at ON.",1
2023,"If you're a regular Old Navy customer very useful app. Cell phones have such limited space you have to pick and choose which apps are most beneficial. I prefer in-store shopping. Being on a fixed income with today's high gas prices it's good to know if it's worth the drive. Lovely, well made, inexpensive clothing and fantastic sales. I scored a $70 dress for $3 at an end of season sale! This one is a keeper for Old Navy regular customers.",5
2022,"Idk why, but the app signs you out every day, so you have to sign back in. That'd be fine, but auto fill doesn't work on this app, it's the only one. It works for the old navy website, it works for every other app, this is the only one I've ever had a problem with. Useless to me, because I'm not going through my Google passwords and copying and pasting the gibberish password every time. ???????",1
2023,Love when I can buy my kids t-shirts for $7. Nothing cost this much money now days!,5
2022,50% of the time I LOVE this app. Love the ease of it... until there is a substantial sale running. Then the app won't even open! I can't get the app to open for more than a moment before it closes itself and offers an error message. Beyond disappointing to miss sales because they can't handle to load on the mobile app. Atleast try to fix this! Update: it's no longer just malfunctioning during sales. I can't even sign in and place an order. I'm going to cancel my CC and take my business elsewhere,1
2021,"Went from a 4 star app to a 1 star app. I cannot sort the items to find what I need anymore. The orders page hasn't worked since this update. When you hit back, it takes you to the top of the page instead of back to where you were. This is all around trash. Please fix this. The previous app was kinda old, BUT AT LEAST IT WORKED!",1
2021,Great leggings at affordable prices. Most of my workout/exercise clothing comes from Old Navy because they fit well and have a wide variety of colors. I'm not into the typical black/gray. I have a huge assortment of their colored leggings and tanks to mix and match. I dont believe in the spending around $100 for just one pair of leggings. I like options and variety. Try them.,5
2021,"Lately it won't stay open, I hit it it opens for one second then closes immediately! Very frustrating. I also agree with other, I hate that if you go look at an item when you return to the list it goes to the top of the page.",2
2021,"I had to uninstall and redownload the app just to log in and have all these log in issues. Now it keeps saying ""uh oh there is an unexpected error"" and asks me to hit refresh, and when I do it just spins. When it's not doing that, it's telling me my passowrd is wrong and prompts me to change it. On e I change it, I'm told it's incorrect again.",1
2021,App worked wonderfully the first time I used it (looking past that there's no way to sort items only filter them). Made one purchase via this app and it has been crashing ever since. Literally can't get it to do anything except show a glimpse of the page then it shuts down. Over and over.,1
2021,"This app is better than their old one for sure. My main frustrations would be the page scrolling back to the top when you back out of a specific product, and not being able to pick the rise of women's jeans (that I can find). Other than that, it's good!",3
2021,"App is literally unusable. I get an error every time I try to look at anything. The main page loads fine, but when I tap on any section, I get an ""Uh oh, something went wrong"" error with the option to refresh. Even tried reinstalling just in case, but get same issue.",1
2023,"App rarely ever loads correctly, I only use it to find out deals so that I can sign in on my laptop later to buy the stuff, seems like you guys could care less about making customers happy if the app still sucks this bad after having it for a year. It's more of a disappointment if anything, I wanna buy stuff from old navy but I literally can't because you guys can't make a simple app that works. I hit the jeans button and it says ""something went wrong"", I hit anything and it takes forever.",1
2022,"App used to be good you could pay your bill through the app but not anymore. You have to go through play store to open the app every time you use it and now it keeps showing ""error"" every time you try to check out. Has to be the app because going directly to the site without using the app you can check out etc. Fix the bugs PLEASE!",1
2021,"Awful app. The old one was better. This ""new and improved"" version never works. It's always giving the ""Oops! Something went wrong."" message. You can't view any of the departments, only the home screen. My app is up to date as well as my software and all that good stuff and it still does not work.",1
2023,"the android app is pretty buggy and pages often don't load, or the app crashes.",2
2022,The app just keeps getting worse and worse now it doesn't even work. Every time I use the app it sends me to the Google Play store to tell me to download the new app which I already have. I then have to click open in the Google store to take me back to the app. Now when I go through all those steps the app shuts down regardless. And if you place an order online as opposed to placing it on the app even though it's your account you cannot see it on the app.,1
2022,"This app used to be flawless, but over the last few months, the cart & checkout fail to load consistently. This forces me to switch to the website to check out. Now, only the home page will load and I cannot view any of the actual shopping pages. This app has been rendered nearly useless.",2
2021,"First time user. I lived the app, for one day, mostly because I found that items were unclickable on the online site. Come to find, it was because items were out of stock. After 4 hrs of the app, it had errors and would auto shut down?! So annoying. Especially when I was so close to checking out finally:(",3
2022,"I have always shopped using the app. Now it makes me sign in over and over, I can't add to or view my cart. So far I haven't been able to shop the jeans sale, swim sale, or active wear sale, and that's just counting this week. I've tried clearing the catche and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. To no avail. Also if you have supercash and it goes unused you can turn it into points right. Seems good but $100 in old navy supercash is 100 points which only equals $1.00. Boo ??????",1
2023,Old Navy has great prices!,5
2021,"DONT INSTALL!!! Sends push notifications non stop until you turn off, constantly have to keep logging in, error message over and over when trying to browse. App does not make things easy. It's basically a way for Old Navy to push ads to your phone.",1
2021,"I don't understand the dislike for the new app. It's 100x more responsive than the old one. Search results are almost instantaneous. Maybe some features that I don't use have been removed or regressed, but I haven't seen any loss of function for me. Provide feedback and I'm sure updates will come. I'm happy with it.",5
2022,"I love Old Navy clothing! I am always able to find really great tops, dresses, jeans and more in my size! The sizes are true to fit a sz 12 is a sz 12 and not a sz 8! The no hassle in store return policy makes shopping online (for those of us who like to browse without time limits) my preferred method of shopping. I really appreciate the the inclusion of all sizes at the same price by Old Navy.",5
2022,"the new app isn't as user-friendly as the previous one. it also crashes a lot Edit: they did another app update. Now it's unusable. All you get is a spinning icon as it tries and tries and tries to load. Alas, nothing ever loads and the app is unusable.",1
2022,"I love old navy, their styles have come so far in recent years! I also love their new app. It is connected with their credit card so you can see your balance right from the app instead of having to log in to the actual credit card app. Very user friendly.",5
2022,"Horrible app. Any positive reviews must be fake or about the clothes in general, not the app. It is extremely glitchy. I have never come across a clothing app with so many glitches. Loading errors, checkout errors, signs me almost every time. Searching for items always reloads me back to the beginning. This app has all the problems. Avoid using if possible.",1
2022,"Everytime I log in, I tap on my card to make a payment, and it says there an error. EVERYTIME. Update 10/14/22. Making a payment is now completely useless with this app. It's saying that I have a balance due for 9/2, but when I go to the actual website on a browser, it says I have a balance of 0.",1
2021,"Love the Old Navy app but it keeps giving me login trouble. Everytime I try to login it says my username and or password do not work. I have reset password multiple times, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the application, I have reached out to old navy about the issue and they reset the password and I make a new one. Still does not work with the app. I dont know where it is malfunctioning but i wish it would work. I love the app, when it wants to work which was very brief for me.",3
2022,"What did you do to the app? It no longer works, it keeps asking me to log in, right after I log in, and won't add anything to the cart, just keeps saying uh-oh/refresh. I switch to BR and it won't let me browse, keeps saying the same thing, uh-oh/refresh. I even uninstalled&restart to see if it would fix, but it wasn't that. Fix it.",1
2021,"Decent clothes and deals. Not fond of the elastic in the tops of the more reasonably priced leggings (very thin and uncomfortable for what you usually want to wear leggings for) or the general, common length of the shirts for plus size. I'm not huge, but I prefer my mid section stay covered.",4
2022,"The app was just updated in my device and I am trying to place an order but unfortunately it has the sign in bar over the box where I am supposed to enter my password. So, I am not even able to sign in. Thanks for nothing. Here it is June 5, 2022 and the app is still not allowing me to sign in. I can only enter my email, the box to enter password has the sign in bar over it. OLD NAVY you all need to do better.",1
2021,"I HATE THE NEW APP?????????? I tried to uninstall it and go back to an older version but I knew it wouldn't work. Silly me I was thinking there was a glitch and the reinstall would fix it. NOT?? Then I scroll through the reviews and I'm not alone. I'm retired and home EVERYDAY, I really don't NEED that many clothes....but ON has an excellent selection of comfortable leggings and lounge ware. Retail therapy at ON during COVID helped me, until the new app. Just fix it please.",1
2021,Home page works fine but I haven't been able to go to any sections or see any actual products in at least a couple of weeks. Everything just pops up with a something went wrong page. There have been a couple of updates since but they haven't helped.,1
2022,"I constantly get ""something went wrong"" pages and when you refresh it reloads the error page and you get stuck in a loop. Nothing will add to my cart because of this error. I've been wanting to shop for a a few days and just gave up because of this app.",1
2021,"The ""new"" app is horrible. I haven't purchased in a while because it's too complicated to use and rarely works as I'm always directed to refresh and refreshing doesn't fix problem. Combining the women's sizes into one shopping department has made it harder to shop my size. Not a fan.",1
2021,I haven't been able to successfully use the app once. Its unavailable or crashed on me. Also on the old app I had the ability to manage my credit card account and that doesn't seem like it's even an option now. Definite downgrade.,1
2022,"I would like it more if it didn't glitch where you have to sign in every time you open the app. Also, you can't use physical super cash that you got from the store for online orders. I tried everything with multiple different ones and they never work so I either have to go to the store or let them expire.",3
2022,This app is very slow and glitchy. It asks me to sign in everytime which is annoying. I wish it would remember me. And sometimes I have to sign in like 3 times for it to work! I've had this app for years and it hasn't improved very much. Whoever has been working on this app??-old Navy needs to hire someone else.,1
2021,"I don't understand how the user experience can be so horrible. There is no way to filter the results properly (only by the category? I can't even filter what kind of jeans I want to look at, I have to scroll through all of them), I can't access my orders even though I'm logged into my account, I keep getting an error message. This app is basically useless, I end up having to use my computer to browse and check out.",1
2022,"I have had terrible experience with this app for some time. It's very slow, and I get errors repeatedly. I find it very frustrating and use the site instead IF I care to deal with it at all. The native app SHOULD be the fastest thing.",1
2021,App and website hasn't let me complete an order without calling customer service for over a month. As soon as I press the select payment method button an error pops up telling me to call customer service to complete the order. Several times I have missed out on the item I wished to buy because it is gone by the time I get customer service to enter the product code. I've also been hung up on several times. Fire everyone. Would give it zero stars if possible.,1
2021,Fake reviews have rated this high.. I know because nobody has been able to use this app without an error message preceding it's crash. All Gap.inc apps won't open after working fine for years. Used this or Gap app to shop and pay my bill. Both apps since the update WILL NOT OPEN. I've uninstalled and reinstalled both apps. Not opening ever. No way could this have received 4.7 stars.,1
2023,"This app is even worse than my original review. It never loads the categories for shopping. Not even worth using it because it never works. Orders and shipping address will never load. After going back to the main selections after looking at an item in detail view the page takes you all the way back to the beginning of category. It doesn't take you back where you left off. Such a waste of time. Rewards are easier to see on new app, but I would take the old app back any day.",1
2021,When I try to access my account on this app it crashes. The same username and password can successfully access the web version. Not sure how to fix this issue. I've tried installing the app on my tablet and same problem occurs.,1
2021,"The new app is really horrible. It's so difficult to find things. When you filter several things dissapear, it's not intuitive at all. I think is down now and I can't even see the options, my account or one of my orders, it keeps saying ""refresh"".",1
2022,"Always takes forever to load, if it even does at all. I check to see if the app needs an update, but it never does. Also, it constantly shows that I have no items saved as favorites when I had favorited a bunch of items, it just deletes them all.",1
2022,"Log-on process too complicated. Your only option is to remember your password. It logs out constantly. It doesn't store your user name. Even if you set for biometrics, it doesn't allow it logging in - I don't understand the point of that. It doesn't allow Google to fill in a saved password. There is no way to log on unless you remember your password. Then you go to the website to reset with a code to your email. So just use the website. Google will store your password. The app is just a hassle.",1
2022,"Too many technical issues. Never saves my passwords. And, I haven't been able to order anything through the app for weeks now. I always get an error message and end up having to go through the website/browser. I'm not even bothering to place the order this time.",1
2021,"App works ok... but what's really frustrating is is selecting a department to shop, finding a cute shirt on a list of 1,300 other items, selecting that cute shirt and then select to go back to the 1300 other items and being returned to the very top of the page... every time you even look at an item! I have to scroll down, every single time, to view where I left off. I feel like I'm wasting my time scrolling. Why not send me back to the last item that I viewed on the list?",2
2021,"Love it too much! I've been going outside of my budget, especially this holiday season, ordering from this app. ?? Shipping times have gotten incredibly FAST lately, which is just the opposite of what you would expect during the holiday season. Good job!",5
2022,I can barely sign in most of the time. The filters never work and when I switch categories it just doesn't load. There are numerous other glitches but this app just doesn't work properly. I will say this a few months ago it was not this bad so I'm not sure what's happen since then.,1
2021,"I am not happy with this update. When I try to launch the app it takes me back to the play store and tells me to update - which I already have. Also, when I choose an item to view and then close it out it takes me all the way back to the top and then you have to scroll back down to find where you were. Its very irritating.",1
2021,"The new update provides a nicer user interface, the loss of 1 star due to the entire credit card system not connecting for almost two weeks after the update. Once I see more consistency from that, I'll definitely change it to 5 stars.",4
2022,"The app requires me to manually enter my password. Each time I have to reset it. Kind of frustrating! Other than that, I like that I can scan a barcode for ordering additional items, in a different color, that aren't available in the store.",4
2022,"App is a bit slow. The deals are great but sometimes it gets annoying how slow the pages load which makes me less likely to complete a purchase. Sometimes a page will not load at all. Other than that, good app.",4
2021,"Uh oh! Nothing is loading at all. I updated and now nothing shows up when I click on a category. It just says ""Something Went Wrong"" and gives this ""Uh Oh!"" message. Tried closing the app all the way down and refreshing, deleting app cache. Nothing is working since I updated.",1
2023,"The latest update is horrible. The main page just spins and spins while never loading. When I open the app it asks if I want to update, even though I have, and if I sign in it glitches and acts like I didn't just sign in. Please, please fix this. I'll change this review once the app is fixed.",1
2023,"Always get a Something is Wrong error. Also, i click on an item then back out, the app takes me to the top of the category again. I don't have time to browse repeatedly... haven't placed an order in over a month due to the technical errors",3
2023,"This app and even the website are horrible! The app freezes all the time. Can't shop at all. The website doesn't even let you log in because when you try entering your email address, it automatically tells you ""error."" I don't know who's responsible for the tech side but they need to be fired. Get it together.",1
2022,This app would be great if pages would actually load and you could finish checking out. Lately I have to finish my order on the website. The main page won't load either. It's also very slow. I love the store for buying affordable denim but the app needs fixing.,2
2021,The app is horrible. It won't link my account so I don't have to sign in on another site to pay my card. And when I do login to pay my card it keeps telling me there's an error. It keeps asking me to register my account every time I try to sign in. It's easier to navigate the website than the app.,1
2021,The free shipping with $50 purchase is a bit tricky if you're not paying attention. You have to go to another page to change it to free shipping. It doesn't automatically do it with $50 in purchases like competitors apps. A little misleading.,3
2022,"8/1/22 still can't check out... for several weeks now I've had items in my cart, trying to check out, but everytime it takes me to an error screen that says ""something went wrong"" the only option is to hit refresh but when I do it takes me back to my cart and the saga starts all over again.",1
2021,"Janky app. Orders placed weren't even shipped by delivery date. They use some random shipping company (Lasership? Seriously?) that drops the ball on shipping. 3 of 4 of the items I ordered were never shipped! They then canceled my order when I was just trying to find out where it was. They then offered me 15% off my next order, as if I want to go through this hassle again. Go to the store, but avoid buying from Old Navy online. I won't again. Disappointed by Old Navy for the last time.",1
2022,"Looks nice & is well organized. Very good app when it works. Unfortunately, it is super glitchy. It rarely loads, asks me to sign in multiple times & often kicks me out. It usually causes a lot of frustration & then I give up on my shopping.",2
2021,"Tried to use a free shipping code the company sent me because they ran out of stock of an item I ordered The code would never show up on the order so I cancelled it. And yes, I triple checked the code was correct and not expired. I was thinking about joining their club rewards program but that flaw put me off of it.",1
2021,"This app moves faster than the last app. But they took away some great functions, like remembering in your search list where you were instead of always returning to the top of the list.",3
2021,"Wish I didn't delete the old app right away! I haven't looked at everything yet, but one of the most annoying things is, if you look at something and you go back and it takes you all they way back to the top and not where you left off and this app does exactly that!",2
2022,"App is not working! I just added a bunch of clothes for my son to my cart and when I went to check out, I kept getting asked to login. I logged in at least 4 times and still wouldn't let me check out. It also was giving me an error message when I tired refreshing the page or tried to go back to the previous page I was on.",2
2022,"The app doesn't even open since the latest update. Instead, it tries opening in the background all day and I'll get constant notifications that it failed to do so. It was bad before but now it's basically just a waste of phone space.",1
2021,"I like having this app..It's very convenient and easy to use..They have great deals a lot of the time, so I do recommend signing up for the text alerts..They text you the deals and it's only 1-3 texts per week..If you like Old Navy, I definitely recommend this app.",5
2023,"Horrible to use. Just so glitchy. Why even keep it in use? Never stays signed in. Doesn't remember my info like I select. Never loads pages from the app notifications... Or just load pages when I open the app. Just ""loads"" forever. When I do get it to work, I search for items & it tends to reset to the home page and I have to start my search from the beginning. If I could give it 0 stars I would.",1
2021,"Trash! This app does not load ever!! It will not show you your favorites, it will not search items when you want it to, and it only works on special occasions for some reason. This is the worst shopping app I have ever used. I expected better from old navy.",1
2022,"Just downloaded the new ""updated"" app and it won't let me sign in. It will let you pay as a guest but then you don't get credit for your purchase. It will, however, let you pay your credit card. The app is glitchy and not nearly as useful as the old one!",2
2023,"Just like everyone says, this app is absolute garbage. Pages don't load, the filtering sucks and I always see a glitch in the text where it gets larger and larger as you scroll down on certain items. What a weird bug to have.",1
2022,"The app loads and everything but when I look at my credit card info it is different than if I log in on the web. I made a payment Dec 5th (due the 5th), this reflects on the web. In the app it says I made payment late, Dec 6th, and it shows 2 payments for the same amount at different times and showing I'm charged TWO late fees. Since it doesn't show like this on the web then I'm assuming this is an app issue. Please fix.",2
2022,"This app is terrible and has been for years. It crashes, if you put something if you cart and set your phone down for 10 minutes the items in your cart disappear. Half the time items won't even load. FOR YEARS, Old Navy is downright disrespecting it's customers for refusing to fix this app!",1
2022,"I really like old navy however this app repeatedly logs my out when i flip from section to section. Ive waited a few updates to post this, hoping they would fix this issue but, unfortunatly, nope! 9/20/22 The constant sign out issue is STILL happening. I think I'm just going to uninstall this app as it seems like the developers don't care :/",1
2022,"Registered. Can't access my account through the app. It says use to us form link and call a number in form to get help. The link doesn't work. I was able to open my account in Chrome but not the app. Uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled. Same thing. Useless.",1
2022,"The update is horrible. I have updated the app and every time I try to launch it it prompts me to update again. Also, I have placed an order and received it, but all of the items are still in my cart and the order does not show in my order history.",1
2022,"I love the large variety of available jeans sizes and colors. However, sometimes the length is unpredictable. We have jeans in the same sizes (waist x length), but the actual lengths vary greatly. Having to give away perfectly good jeans for my son because they're now too short after only a few wears. ??",4
2022,"BOPIS feature is useless. Old Navy are incapable of keeping track of their inventory. Twice now, I have shopped online to pickup at store, and twice now, Old Navy have placed my funds on hold only to email me 1 hour later telling me that NONE of the items that their own app/website said were available are actually available...takes 7 days for the hold to drop in my bank account! So, now I have to wait a week before I can even shop for these items...elsewhere, of course.",1
2021,"I cannot use the app, anytime i try to narrow down my seach using sections tabs, anything, even switching to the sister stores in app ""there is a connection problem"" high reason to believe it is not on my end. Quite sad it can update me on current deals i cannot see anything just the home menu any interaction nonresponsive",1
2022,"The app REALLY struggles to open and load. Signs me out constantly, even though I use it fairly often, and either takes several minutes to load a page or just doesn't do it at all. They need to do a lot of work on it.",3
2022,Its embarrassing for such a large company app to not be functioning properly. As you can see from other bad ratings its been having problems a while. It asks a million times to sign in even after youve already done so. When i click on a certain section to view clothes it wont load! I have patience only bcuz i need things for winter time and cant go in-person. OLD NAVY FIX THE PROBLEMS IN THE APP. SAMSUNG NOTE 20. THANKS,1
2022,"When the app works I have no issues, but it hardly ever works! It makes me sign in over and over again and I repeatedly receive the message that says ""something went wrong"" which makes it very frustrating to shop.",2
2022,"Kicks me out, always has an error, trying to get back to search results sends you back to the top of the list. I just tried to place an order but was kicked out thanks to an ""error."" Now my bag is empty but I have no orders. Looked on the website and it's not there either. I hate this app.",2
2022,"50% of the time it works great. The rest of the time it doesn't load pages or items, always tells me ""something went wrong"", and honestly, I hate that it won't save my log in info ever. Too glitchy and temperamental.",2
2021,I really don't understand the putting of the women's and the plus size options together. This was actually one of the places that I loved being able to just click on plus size and knew that everything I was looking at was going to be in my size. Now I have to scroll through everything and get disappoonted if I see something cute only to click on it and it not come in my size. Not cool Old Navy. The old way was just fine.,1
2022,Pop ups that cover nearly the whole screen while trying to log in / sign up is super frustrating. Also I should be able to pay with a debit card. Most difficult time I've had paying bills.,1
2022,"Every other icon I click ""oops, something went wrong"". Well no kidding!! Totally useless piece of rubbish. I wish I could go back to the old app. Edit: 18 months later and absolutely NO improvement! If anything, it has gotten worse. Ditching this crapp!",1
2022,"Keeps signing me out and once I get to sign in, I can't add anything to my cart. Going on two weeks of this... Before this, barely any of my liked items were saving and I was having glitches trying to view items. The app is so laggy and weird anymore...what's even happening, Old Navy??",1
2022,"Does not work. I am not sure why but every time I open the app, I get a blank screen. Unable to do anything and I wait so long. Ordering would be ideal on the app and not on the website but it isn't usable. Drives me crazy. I've had the issue ever since downloading the app.",1
2022,"It's great until you want to purchase something. I don't know when the last time was I successfully made a transaction through the app. Always says ""something went wrong"". I've missed out on sales, promos etc bc of this. Please fix it!",2
2022,"I think it would be great if it worked. The layout and search is very user friendly, however, the app often gives errors, doesn't respond or just keeps loading. Mostly unusable.",2
2022,Id give it a 5 but the app sometimes doesn't work properly I have been trying for the past 3 days to check out my order when items were on sale. today before I checked out saw some items were no longer available or rose in price I still got it regardless cause my kid needs it. However would have liked to get it when I saw the original sale price and when they were available rather than wait for it to finally allow purchase.,3
2023,"First the app stopped working, then my points started disappearing without explanation. I contacted them and they won't do anything about it. I'm not even sure if it's connected but the app is so useless it wouldn't surprise me at all. Thinking it might be time to cut up the card and shop somewhere else.",1
2022,App is so slow and glitchy!! It won't even load the page half the time. And it makes you constantly log back in. Super frustrating and annoying. I'd rather use the web browser to shop. Please fix it!!,1
2022,"This app never fully loads pages and when you click on categories, it also hangs. I have a 2022 phone so I know that it's not me. It's a shame. I wanted to buy on Cyber Monday and couldn't. Tried several times and even during downtime. Same result.",1
2022,"Used to be fine but recently something changed. Constantly tells me something went wrong, refresh and the only way I can get it to work again is to Uninstaller and reinstall every time. Very annoying. Makes me shop less as I often use my mobile device to shop.",1
2023,"This app frequently doesn't work. There was just an update, and it won't load the sale from notifications still, and it won't load any categories to manually browse. Both problems aren't new, but are maybe worse now.",1
2022,"App only responds 1% of the time. It takes forever to load if it does at all. Whether or not I'm signed in, if I try to edit my cart or go to checkout it sends me into a never ending loop of being redirected to the sign in page and you can't get out of it.",1
2022,"I really don't like your app I love your clothes, but accessing your website through a browser on my phone is easier than using your app. It glitches so much of it will load a page at all, and to boot after I look at an item and return to the previous page it takes me all the way back to the top. The app has been like this since I downloaded it. I've never left a review for anything in my life and I just wanted to leave this here because of how passionately disappointed I am in this app ??",1
2023,"Uninstalled Would be nice if after looking at an item and going back to the search, it kept your place. Instead, it clears filters and starts over in the category. Additionally, it does not stay logged in, I have to log in every time I do a search, or want to shop. I will just go to the website, less hassle there. Android user Galaxy s22 ultra",1
2022,This app never works. Every time you try to change pages it gives an error and won't load. It also won't let you check out. Anytime I try to log in to check out it crashes. It cost me $110 in super cash because it wouldn't let me check out any way other than as a guest.,1
2022,By default it makes you sign in w/user & password every time you open the app. Stupid. Otherwise it's fine. Edit: you can enable biometric login via account settings. Defaults are still stupid. It's a smartphone app. Just keep me logged in ffs.,4
2022,The search bar is a useless option results dont even match what you are looking for. Trying to find just flannel shirts should not make you want to pull your hair out. 100% done with old navy online and in store!,1
2023,"Still not working... I click on a push notification about a special sale, and the app opens to a blank screen with a category title on top and the spinning wheel spinning spinning spinning. Using the back button to return to the main product page from product details page goes to a completely blank screen.",2
2023,"I don't know what's going on with this app. It keeps shutting down, freezing up, starting over while looking at an item. I wish this app didn't have sooo many bugs in it. I like shopping on app verses shopping online.",1
2022,"Old Navy is great but the app is terrible and borderline unusable. Constantly glitching, makes you sign in every time you access a new page, half the time it just gives error codes, desperately needs to be fixed.",1
2022,"I don't know what happened with this app - it used to work fine. But now it will not save my login. Even when I manually enter my login, it won't save my cart in my account. when I try to pay, it always gives me an error with my Old Navy card!! The only way I can check out is if I use a different payment method, which negates the whole reason I have an Old Navy card, to earn rewards.",2
2022,"After many uses, I have to edit my review. Pages don't load! While it's thinking, I'm growing old and losing interest in the item I wanted to buy. I've also checked the setting to use my fingerprint for sign in many times, but it never remembers.",1
2023,Buggy CANT USE SUPER CASH! I keep getting emails about using my $30 super cash before it expires and the app won't let me use it! It doesn't have my rewards right at all either. I'll have to go on the computer. App sucks always.,1
2022,"I'd love to shop on the app but everytime I click something I get the spinning wheel of death, and it rarely loads. It keeps prompting me to update the app without any improvement. Very glitchy, it's basically useless.",2
2023,"AWFUL. Half the time, no page will load at all. If you can even get that far, don't plan on actually purchasing anything you've found?the Place Order button just takes you to an error every time. What a piece of trash.",1
2022,"Great app with easy ordering! Once you go to your cart, it isn't easy to go back to shopping & you have to redo your filters everytime. If that were fixed, I'd give it 5 stars.",4
2022,"Not impressed... not sure why I'm getting another credit card in the mail?(when I didn't ask for it and mines not expired?) I hope you didn't pull my credit without my permission. The wait for customer service is ridiculous, and the app isn't anything special. If my credit was ran again which I'm about to check everything. I will be coming for you.",1
2021,"911! What a mess! Once again, ON and Gap prove they can't develop a user friendly app. Where are discounts??? Every time you click back from an item on shopping list, it jumps all the way to top of list. Also have to scroll all the way to bottom of home screen to find categories. And please put all kids unisex clothes in their own category. I have to scroll through twice as many shirts now because I don't want monster trucks on my daughter's shirts-those who do can go to unisex.",1
2023,"I love Old Navy, it's my new favorite store to buy clothes. However, I hate this app. It does not leave me logged in. It does not save any of the items I want. If I click on something and then go back to the original page, it puts me all the way back to the top of the page. It is extremely frustrating. I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it, and nothing works.",1
2022,"The worst. You can't make any changes to your order easily, and just when you think you have, you get the order email and find the item you THOUGHT you set to pick up in store is actually coming in the mail. Last week, I apparently ordered two of the same sweater but didn't discover this till it came in today. I'm gonna stick to ordering online.",3
2023,This app is terrible which is so disappointing. I think you are losing a lot of possible sales due to the poor performance.,1
2023,"I've had constant issues with this app for months. Won't load properly, gives me an error message. I can't shop, and end up having to go through the actual website to shop/make purchases. The issues persist even though it says the app is updated",2
2023,"Can you please fix this new update. The app don't want to work. it's keep said update available, I did it and still saying the same.",1
2023,This app is so buggy. Things take forever to load or don't load at all. Browsing is nearly impossible. If I try to search on my phone's browser instead it just redirects me to the useless app. Need to delete it.,1
2022,"This app very often has trouble loading pages other than the main. I often give up, even when I got a notification about a sale that looked good. They are probably losing sales because of this! If this wasn't an issue, I'd say it's a pretty good app.",2
2021,Too slow to populate...unable to choose style or color because the descriptions are all jumbled together...horrible...I also don't like having to put my cc number in every time I want to buy something...and most of the time I just give up because I don't keep my cc with me all the time...it use to be where you just choose the the last 4 digits of your cc...so aggregating,1
2021,"Very UNorganized! Keeps asking to download ""new"" app even when it's already downloaded. Keeping up with my credit card payments are a chore, bcz it's so hard to pull up the credit account, always defaulting to the SHOP page! Straight up annoying!",1

2021,"This update is the worst. I have been unable to review my order, see what promos I have (super cash, Credit Card promos, etc) since the ""update"". Totally not user friendly, at all. Unfortunately, I deleted the old app and am stuck with this one until it's fixed.",1
2021,"This app might be new, but it's far from being improved.....or even functional. The app comes up fine, but an error message comes up when I try to shop. You're constantly disappointing me, Old Navy!!! One more strike and we're through!",1
2022,"The app boots up fine, but if you click on any of the categories it takes a whole 60 seconds to load. Even then it just delivers an ""unable to process your request"" screen.",1
2022,"I live in the middle of nowhere, so driving to a store, isn't an option it's a full day trip. so I love using the app to make my purchases and for the most part it's easy to use. much easier, than the Barclays app.",5
2023,I haven't purchased from Old Navy in quite a while since the app never loads I just get the loading icon and then errors,1
2022,This has to be one of the worse apps I've ever used. Errors everywhere and on top of that it keeps logging me off after each error. When I'm simply trying to add stuff to my cart here come a error and now my cart is empty over and over again each time I try.,1
2022,This app hardly ever loads pages. It just swirls and swirls and then finally let's you know something went wrong. It's almost every page or category of clothing you try to select. It's almost unusable.,1
2022,"app doesn't keep you signed in. i have to go through my browser to shop because the app keeps telling me to refresh or sign in. - when i add something to my cart or try to view my cart it never shows me anything. - the app used to work though, so once that part is fixed i'm sure it will be worth having again.",1
2022,Back to square one. Frequent failures to load. No way to see or apply current promos because it just spins. End up having to go use a computer instead. Total waste of time!,1
2023,Never loads! I get notifications all the time and can't open the app to see.,1
2022,"App has some problems with content when filters are applied. also don't like when you view an item then go back, it takes you back to the top versus going back to the last item viewed to continue scrolling.",4
2022,"Whoever is in charge of your app upgrades needs to spend some time with people who actually shop at Old Navy and have $$$$ to spend. This demographic I would think are moms. We do not want a merry go round of images when we click to view another color of leggings. We also want to shop quick and don't want to log in every 2 minutes. And if we get all done shopping and the app says 'Something went wrong' we get pissed and don't come back. GalaxyS22Ultra, over wifi&5G reinstall app nothingworks",1
2022,"Great deals all the time. I've been a customer of Old Navy since high school and now I'm an adult, nothing has changed. I've also very pleased that they've widen their plus size clothing given I'm a little heavier now but I still get to look stylish without breaking the bank.",4

2022,"I love Old Navy, this has nothing to do with the brand itself..... but the App. Every single time I go into the app, I am logged out, even with the biometric turned on. It's quite annoying when I want to look at a piece of clothing, but before I can view it & add to my cart, I have to log in again",3
2023,"The most useless app award goes to..... Old Navy! Hands down the worst shopping app ever. You'd think such a large company could get a decent app developer. Their website isn't much better either. I have deleted the reinstalled several times, hoping it would get better. It NEVER does.",1
2022,"New update 10/12/22 is awful!! Love Old Navy but just went to order on the app and had to update. Since updating, it's glitching and keeps telling me to sign in everytime I try to look at a new item. Discount not applying to all items in my cart either. Please fix this!!",1
2022,This app is useless. I've been trying to make a payment but kept getting a wrong password/username message. So now I have to call to make a payment but even then is customer service care the worst! I have to call to confirm my payment and I still end up with a late fee.,1
2022,"Keeps asking for update. I have a galaxy note 10 plus Every time I open the app it ask to be updated if there was a easy way to just x out fine but it always sends me to the Google app store and does not let me search I have to go online and sign in so I can purchase, check sales or just browse. Is there something I'm doing wrong. App has been updated my phone has been update.",1
2022,"I think old navy is under rated. the sales that old navy has are great. Back to school shopping is a breeze.

2021,"Horrible! I can't get past the first screen because it freezes and then crashes every single time. The old app wasn't great, but this one is completely unusable!",1
2021,"I hate this new version of ON. I can't find anything I'm looking for, when you go in to look at an item and go back out, it makes you start all the way back at the top of the page so you have to scroll through 1000's of items again to get back to where you were. Very frustrating!!!",1
2021,This app is great but the My Orders tab always has issues or needs to constantly be refreshed. I also don't like having to automatically be sent back to the top of the page when you click on an item and then go back to view them all again.,4
2022,"I've been completely unable to sign in for some time now. There is a space for your email address but there is nowhere to put in a password and the ""sign in"" button stays grayed out. Extremely disappointing. Have to delete because it's just a waste of space at this point.",1
2022,"Ever since the new company took over I have been having issues with my account. Signing up, signing in, app not working at all. This is ridiculous especially since I have cc and can't even check that account. Why do we have to create new everything anyway. Our stuff should have been able to transition right over.",1
2023,"Fails to work often, right now says there is an update, but doesn't show a update at app store",3
2022,Great when it works which lately is not often. Makes me repeatedly log in. Will not let me check out. Crashes. Extremely frustrating and time consuming. Quicker and easier to shop in web browser than through app.,1
2023,"The app is awful now. Last year it worked perfectly fine but lately it's a problem every time I try to use it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice and it's done nothing to help. In fact, it's telling me to update now but when I open it on Google play it's up to date.",1
2022,"great app, easy to shop. easy to apply your promos and discounts. only suggestion is to fix the sizing charts, i.e. in women's underwear they have the sizing by number (0-18) instead of s, m, l, xl, xxl, etc. same with men's shirts, only shows neck size and not chest size.",5
2023,"Takes a long time to load, constantly signs me out, biometric login settings don't work.",1
2022,"The rewards are great. You're going to spend money anyway, why not get your kids free clothes ? Also, Old Navy is the only brand I can find that has 28"" waist, with 36"" inseam. High quality jeans, 100% ! My guys are tall !! Thank you Old Navy !! Plus, the App has really become user friendly ; )",5
2023,Same problem others have mentioned. The app opens but when I try to shop it says something has gone wrong. I can't look at anything to shop. It's been doing the same thing for about a month. I have a Samsung S20 so moth a super old phone and I made sure the app didn't have an update that needed download.,1
2022,App never works! Even after updates install it never loads properly! And it's always so annoying to sign in before I can even shop! At least add biometrics login! About 99% of time time I don't even shop because I can't get logged in because I always forget the password.,1
2023,This app is horrible. Got an update and now my most recent orders are missing. Last ones are from January. Just received an order today and it isn't there. Good job on update. ?? It has gotten worse. Just deleting the app and using website one. Much better.,1
2021,"I can't sign in! I have a Galaxy S10. I can enter my email. But the ""Sign In"" sits right on top of where I need to enter the password! Very poor design! You all need to get someone that knows how to design a useful app. Very disappointing!",1
2023,"Doesn't work, doesn't load. It's a dead app. If I wanted to see Old Navy screen I'd snap a picture and use it as a background. That's literally all it did. You can't sign in online either so I tried the app. Apparently Old Navy/Gap is not able to keep tech up and running.",1
2022,"Awful app! Go to add tems to my cart and states ""something went wrong"" and will not refresh. Then keeps logging me put of my account. When I go to log back in. The same message comes up! Wad so much easier when you could switch between GAP and Old Navy in 1 app!!",1
2023,"Terrible app, super slow, poor loading. Had to uninstall and use my browser its so bad.",1
2022,"Won't place order. Forced to use new app, kept telling me something went wrong and to refresh. Had to go online and place my order. Was warning me black Friday items would only be in the cart for 30 minutes. Didn't order all I wanted to because I didn't want to lose my kid gifts in my cart. New app cost you money and angered a long time customer. This app is useless.",1
2022,"Horrible user experience, the absolute worst merchant app I have ever tried to use. Searches are useless. ""Girls sleep shorts"" shows you toddler and maternity pajamas. Searching for the exact name of an item-- long sleeve graphic T-shirt for girls-- makes you wade through a list of 20+other items. ""Technical problems"" with Paypal to finish it off. Old Navy, only your clothes should be this cheap and disposable; your app development should be worlds better than this.",1
2021,I love the app... its very convenient... my issue is I have $80 ($50 and 3 $10) and I can't use them all in one transaction with my total being over $300... it makes me not want to shop here... then you can't use them on sale items... too many stipulations...,2
2023,Randomly force stops. Shuts down whenever I first open the app. Has to buffer the same options every time I press anything. Terrible experience. Good prices and selection is the only reason I give two stars.,2
2022,"Terrible app. The darn thing keeps freezing. Can't shop nor pay my cc bill on it. Actually I can't even get past the dang on sign in. Get it together! Only option is to delete. When ya figure out the app game, send me a message!",1
2021,"App never works right, and when you do a large order and find everything in the sizes you need the payment doesn't go through. Bugs need to be fixed. It's a hassle to order online, all the time.",1
2021,"App hasn't worked since you released it. Bring the old one back. Tired of the ""something went wrong message"".I can't access my orders and as a result can't do a return. Yes, I can go online, but then why bother having an app.",1
2022,"It's been a hot mess of an app: it's pushing shopping notifications but can't load the page it's trying to advertise Can't stay logged in Forever loading screen It's really frustrating, I no longer want to deal with this app.",2
2021,"This app will never work for me. I have installed and uninstalled it several times and still no luck. When I go to open the app, it just crashes, everytime. I have it uninstalled again now. Something needs to be fixed before I will install again.",1
2021,"After this version replaced the previous one, I am no longer able to make a payment on my Old Navy credit card. The payment option is missing. Additionally, the Wallet page is unavailable. Don't waste your time on this app.",1
2021,"Why bother with this app? Cannot shop on this app. It will give you an error message. Whether you click on a picture or do a search, it doesn't work. Only thing that seems to work is the wallet function. You can see your rewards balance and and supercash. But I don't know how you are suppose to use them if you can't shop on the app.",2
2021,"Can't access order history, wallet, cart...new app is awful. I like the look and functionality of swapping between brands but what's the point if you can't actually use the important features? Please fix!",2
2021,I like the previous version better. The search and filter feature leave a lot of things out that should be included. The Save Item feature does not work.,2
2023,sometimes the app glitches which makes for a most annoying shopping experience.,3
2023,It never loads so shopping is inaccessible. Pointless app.,1
2023,"Always finding great deals, and easy to use.",5
2023,I freaking love old Navy but with all these deals and the app I spend too much money,5
2023,NEVER WORKS. The app never works and I am ALWAYS going to my Google Chrome to actually visit their site. Whoever is in charge of making the app and the logistics of how it works needs to be replaced. Hasn't worked for MONTHS. Even the newest update fixed NOTHING.,1
2021,Always love shopping Old Navy!! Can't beat those sales especially when it comes to buying school clothes. Only issue was I think a gliche or something at the website I say this because it wouldn't left me chose a category without redirecting me but as soon as I downloaded the app it worked fine. I still give them 5 stars,5
2021,"Constantly Crash, unable to provide any results when searching while in stores or online. Troubleshooting steps doesn't help. I think the old version was way better.",1
2022,Rarely ever works. When it does it takes forever to upload and constantly logs me out of my account. Seems Old Navy has something against androids. Should be this hard to get this app working. What's sad I shop ON ALL the time and probably would be even more if app worked half of the time. I've deleted it before and about to again. UGH,2
2021,"This just in, when you release a new app, if you do it as an upgrade to the previous app people do not have to go to the play store to download the update, and their stored biometrics can remain on the device so they don't have to login again...",1
2021,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I loved the old app, but since this one took its place I have been unable to shop on the app. No matter what screen I try to load (my bag, women's clothes, sale of the day . . .) I get a screen that says, ""Something has gone wrong."" I am unable to use the app at all.",1
2023,App constantly requires log in. It is absolutely useless as I wind up shopping through a browser on my phone. I have yet to be able to shop successfully through the app despite the app being up to date. I will be Uninstalling as it is a waste of time.,1
2021,"Filtering options are terrible for when I want to browse a particular item - for example, I wanted to look at running shorts but the most narrow filter choice is ""active."" Definite downgrade from the old app.",1
2021,"This app is absolutely awful! It makes me want to give up on purchasing anything! Also, when I placed an order the app froze but gave me a confirmation number. When I logged back in to check it claims that I have no recent orders! Just horrible! I hope that I will at least get my order. -10 stars! ??",1
2023,"Awesome Jeans, shorts shirts. Soft material on shirts, in my opinion, they run a lil larger than the jeans say.",5
2022,"It's ok when it works, but more times than not the pages don't load and it just goes blank or sits there loading. Sometimes it's so frustrating that I change my mind about shopping there.",2
2021,"Having nothing but issues with this ""new & improved upgrade"". Very disappointed. Lost everything in my cart, can't access my rewards in my wallet to apply to my order, nothing is working right. ??",1
2023,This app is the terrible. It takes forever to load anything. I feel like I'm using dial up where I log in and walk away.,1
2023,always a great choice and affordable,5
2021,"This app is awful compared to the last one, the pictures are grainy, the filters are worse, the was a whole section for big and tall clothing and that's gone, a major step down.",1
2022,"Every time I get on the app to buy something, it won't let me check out. It will say ""something went wrong"" and I end up having to go on the browser to place am order. Why have an app WHEN IT DOESNT WORK!! It has been doing this to me since April of 2022. It now AUGUST and still having the same problems!!",1
2023,"Frustrating app. I cannot log in with out choosing forgot password and resetting password. I am not typing it in wrong. This has happened over and over, it just will not recognize my password. I don't even change the password, just use the same one.",3
2021,"Worst shopping app of all time. Every link leads to an error message. Constantly ""something went wrong."" Can't ever search by word or barcode! Time to uninstall, wasting space on my phone.",1
2022,This is one of the worst shopping apps around. Crashes alot and takes forever to navigate. Updated review: Updated versions have greatly improved along with ease of in store access to my rewards. Good work!,1
2021,"This new app sucks. I am a huge fan of GAP brands when it comes to shopping, and this app makes the experience a giant pain in the butt. I get error messages constantly, it's very slow to respond. I hate it. I shopped GAP brands a lot partially bc of the ease of shopping in the app. Now it just gives me anxiety.",1
2021,This app SUCKS!! just made me get the new app and it won't stay open. It immediately disappears when I open it. Impossible to use. The old app was working fine. Just in time to miss all the holiday deals too. So annoying.,1
2023,"I always have issues logging in and I get the ""something went wrong"" message constantly now. The filters don't seem to work either... Less than enjoyable experience unfortunately!",2
2023,Garbage. Shuts down constantly. Not up date with store and sizes available anyways.,1
2021,"Since the last update the app has been rendered useless. I've held out on reviewing to give them a chance to fix it, but it's been over a month, as the many other reviews attest, and no improvement (or attempt at improvement) has been made. It's unfortunate because I shop primarily through the app.",1
2021,"With 4 children, 2 of whom have special needs and 2 of whom are tiny tornado toddlers, the ease of ordering online and picking up is a must for me. They can be a little pricey but they have great sales. I appreciate the super cash but which I could combine them and with codes.",4
2021,"App is alright, a little laggy but works. But on principle I give any app 1? for manipulating reviews. You will get a popup in the app that asks if you're loving Old Navy, and your only choices are yes or no - there's no close button. Usually with these if you press no, the adventure ends. But when you press yes, it asks you to rate their app. This first step weeds out potential negative reviews and boosts positive reviews. Some apps take it a step further and don't publish if the review is 1?.",1
2021,I'm trying to check out and pay with my rewards and I have my old navy credit card on file and it tells me they can not process my order. Spent 43 minutes on the phone with old navy and they told me the same thing.

2021,Can't seem to make payments. It always tells me it encountered an error. The old app although it took long I was always able to make my payment on it. This new one just needs a lot of work. Please fix it.,1
2021,"Can't change online order address, can't update shipping address, can't cancel an order, even if it's just been made. All of that has to be done through a phone call which also doesn't have cancel options directly. We are 1/5th into the 21st century what kind of online ordering needs a phone call.",1
2023,App does not load on any page. I'm often asked to sign up for the rewards even when I'm signed into my account and am already signed up for rewards. Lots of bugs on the latest release. This app is trash!,1

I also love that there is a range of jeans in each size for different body types, and they wear well.",5

2022,App is so buggy. Infinite loading times and times out. My account is saved but still asks for it. Needs better speed and uploading or processing function(might not be the correct terminology).,1
2023,Worst app ever! It never loads and I have to constantly force stop it to get it to work.,1
2023,"Just use the web page. Nothing works right, pages won't load, filters don't filter, the whole app just needs to be redone. It's basically unusable.",1
2021,Horrible. I've been trying to order for 3 days to get the order to go through. It's crazy how they have my email to send me sales promotions but doesn't accept my email when I'm placing the order . Also they used to send me $10.00 gift cards on my birthday. My birthday is in May and no gift card last year or this year.,1

2022,"Same ""Oops"" issues. Will not load most of the time. Since Barclay's took over, accessing credit card info is a pain. Keep having to reset password. Logging into account has issues. Being able to shop has issues. Is this Old Navy's way of saying that you're going or of business? (Joke). All seriousness, Old Navy makes too much money to have an app with this many issues.",1

Actually fix it.",1
2023,"Im giving 3 stars because I love Old Navy. But what I don't love is this app, never had a problem before, but it takes forever to load anything. This issue has been happening for a good while now. I want to say around June 2022 since I've noticed it. Please Old Navy fix this.",3

I have upwards of 50 shopping apps and ON is literally the only one that requires I sign in every time I open it.

2022,Had a horrible time trying to place an order online! I canceled whole order and paid with a different credit card when I wanted to use my Old Navyist Account!!!! I'm waiting now gor replacement card but not sure if I want to keep purchasing from here. This is the 3rd time I could not get assisted for am over the order.,1
2021,"Will not let me make a payment, won't let me see my recent orders, Everything I click on says OOPS something went wrong. The old app was more user friendly for sure! Fix it or I'll just delete the app all together, ... possibly even delete/cancel my account too. ??",4
2023,"I can't stand this app. When I click on a notification, blank white page. I click on a category to shop, blank page. Lots of waiting, lots of blank pages. I only use their actual website now.",1
2021,"I love Old Navy! it's really hard as a tall person to find modest clothing, or even to find jeans that arent waddling way above my ankles. but old navy has amazing additional sizing. I have never found any pair of jeans that I didn't like from them. Also, their dresses are beautiful! I'm a huge fan of all their clothing actually and so is my family. Since all of us are tall it's cool to know that we have this extended sizing!",5
2023,App has glitches. Takes forever to load and freezes. Speed test on connection and other apps at the same time on same connection and wifi strength work flawlessly. But this ONE app doesn't.,1
2023,Usually very happy with all purchases.,5
2023,I am able to get everything my grandsons needs to wear out at Old Navy.,5
2023,Great sales! Great products!,5
2023,excellent styles for great price ??,5
2023,I bought and I browsed a bunch of clothes last Christmas thanks to this app but it is very buggy even now I tried browsing for some clothes but the screen froze and when I restart the app I'm stuck on the loading screen for the app or the homepage ?? and I really get really frustrated when I click on the deals and it takes forever to load I thought it was because it was around Christmas time so the app got overloaded but I guess that was not the case ??,1
2023,best prices/style/quality,5
2023,I've slipped this company for more than decade and recommend them highly.,5
2023,love their sizes and fit,5
2023,This app never works properly and the website is just as bad!! Drives me nuts!,1
2021,"This new app is Horrible!! I hadn't looked for several months and when I did, I had to install a new app. Not just update. I had a terrible time maneuvering just to look up hoodies. This layout sucks stunk butt to put it mildly. I'm not even sure I will buy the stuff I finally found. Old Navy why switch ????",1
2021,I can't access the wallet function so I can not pay my bill or see my rewards. I do not going all the back to the beginning of the page EVERY time I look at an item and then return to the list of products. The old app was much better.,1
2021,"I like the app, but I can't sign into my account because the page is full of errors. The sign-in box is covered with words, everything is jumbled together. Anyhow, it's useless if I can't sign in.",3
2023,"The app is easy to navigate, and so far fairly accurate with availability of products. I 10/10 recommend if you love OLD Navy.",5
2023,"It's not terrible when it works. It always has very long loading times. Often the pages say ""something went wrong."" It is much easier to just shop online and not waste your time with the app.",2
2023,"Used to be such a good app to use. Now it's awful. Always asking me to sign in, saying it can't load anything I click on, and going back in the app unfortunately sends me back to the beginning of the page instead of where I left off in scrolling.",4
2022,"I'm keep signing off whenever I select an item. App not letting me do shopping, it's horrible, I want to retrieve an order details, as soon as I click it I'm logged out automatically, super disappointed. ??",1
2023,"This app never wants to load for me. Everytime I go in to shop it gives me the endless loading sign. I usually try about 5 times before I ultimately give up. I would shop alot more if it was more convenient. However, the app restricts me. Hoping they fix this soon.",2
2023,App hasn't worked ever since I downloaded it.,1
2023,I haven't been able to use the app it glitches constantly. old navy has been my go to for years & cannot go in stores most times due to health concerns. Loved the convenience of the app but I guess was too good to be true.,1
2023,App is Glitchy and stalls all the time and extremely frustrating. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still not better. Consider the missed revenue opportunity from people not being able to use the app effectively.,1
2021,"I used to be able to easily sign in and pay my bill. Since the last ""update"" things have been so much worse. Everytime i click on the app it says i need to update then i cant sign in. I went into the store and cant pay in person either. This app is the worst!",1
2022,"Load times are horrible and every time I open the app, it takes me to the download/uninstall page for the app, not directly to the website. Super annoying.",1
2022,I've had the app for an hr and already I'm annoyed with it. I collected somethings in the cart but when I clicked on the cart it wouldn't show me anything I'd collected and said something like cart error. So I reinstalled the app when I couldn't get it to work. Next the app said it only holds clothes in the cart for 30 mins. I apparently take too long because when I was finishing up looking through all of the clothes for 3 kids the cart was empty.,2
2023,Please fix this app keeps loading for a while can't even shop online this app hasn't been working for a while,1
2023,"Keeps signing me out. Every time I try to look at an item, the sign in page pops up and then if I try to sign in it says that something went wrong. It makes it impossible to shop on the app.",1

2023,"The app doesnt load, cant search.. It just spin when clicked on the shop button...",1
2023,I think this is by far the worst app I've ever used. I have issues signing in every time I want to use it.,1
2023,The worst app ever designed!!! Updates never fix it!! Come on Old Navy do better!!!!,1
2023,Glitches. It shows I'm signed in on one page but not the other. Won't load my wallet,1

2023,clothes are sturdy and pretty true to size - love the sales they have!,5
2023,"Old navy is fashion fast , when you on the go.",5
2023,App doesn't open up fast. It takes a few tries.,3

2023,It literally never works? It doesn't load anything. It's been like this for months now.,1

2023,the app continously logs you out. takes forever to load.,2
2023,"App shuts down immediately after opening, even after reinstalling",1
2021,"Only reason I'm giving the app a 1 star is because it won't let me access the ""Wallet"" icon. It's been conveniently down for weeks now and I don't have access to make an online payment or view my coupons.... I'll definitely change once this is resolved!!",1
2023,Outstanding! My main clothing store! Online shopping is terrific!,5
2023,Terrible app. It never works. I try to pay my bill and it says unexpected error everytime I go to wallet. I have to uninstall the app and re-download it.,1
2022,App has always worked great. Now since the updates every time I log in and try to add a item is says error and won't work.. so I guess you won't be getting my business.,1
2023,300 pop ups a second oh my god it's ridiculous and annoying,1
2023,"The app doesn't work, I have to go online to shop. It hasn't worked for awhile.",1
2021,"Everytime that I get a notification of a deal, I'll click on it. As soon as the app loads, I get an error message that something went wrong. I can't look at anything but the hime page.",1

We love shopping ""in"" the Old Navy Stores, but I also love the ease of shopping online using the Old Navy app!Awesome clothes at Awesome prices $$!! That's a ""WIN WIN !!!!"" Thanks Old Navy!",5
2022,"Ok. Can't sort by newest, and dosnt have a lot of filter options ( for example in dresses, you can't sort by length, sleeve, or anything like that. )",3
2023,"When I continue shopping after viewing an item, it scrolls all the way to the top instead of where I legt off. I have tried to put a cart together for 4 ppl but get so frustrated scrolling back down I end up giving up.",2
2021,"Ap showed I had a $40 coupon and said I had to use it at checkout. When I went to checkout the coupon was gone. Also tried to charge for shopping even though I spent much more than the ""$50 free shipping"".",2
2022,Recent update is frustrating. Keeps taking me back to login page and the text input overlay makes it impossible to read/review the login info I've typed. Once I login it won't load.,1
2023,This app never works and crashes all the time.,1
2022,"Honestly, the app sucks. The coupon tab NEVER loads, it has me sign in 5 zillion times ber browse and sometimes won't let me shop without signing in first. It is so incredibly buggy and is a terrible user experience. Tbh sometimes I shop through H&M just because their app is better ???????",1
2022,Every time I try to look at clothes on this app it tells me that I have to sign in again...even if I just signed in 5 min ago. It won't let view any items details until is re-sign in again. So frustrating!,2
2022,"I have never had a problem with the old navy app, however, now I cannot sign in. Every time I try to ,it won't allow me. I have tried uninstalling and re installing the app a couple of times and it still doesn't work.",2
2021,App is glitchy. There is no order history and I can't process returns through it. Even online website is glitchy and slow. Too much on the pages to load. Platform is ancient,1
2021,"Easy & Fun shopping experience! My only negative is that when you click on an item for details, and then go back to shopping, it keeps going back to the beginning.",4
2023,so far everything I've ordered fits perfectly on my granddaughter,5
2023,I love shopping at Old Navy for the latest fashioned all for the right price??,5
2023,They always have something nice for the season and it is very affordable.,5
2023,doesn't always work well. have to reload alot and logs me out,3
2022,I've ordered twice from this app & both times about 5 days after I order I get an email telling me half my order was out of stock. Have ordered twice & it's happened both times. Don't think I'll order anything from here ever again at this point. I'd understand it happening once here or there but both times? They can charge me instantly for items they don't even have & wait almost a week to tell me. Edit - STILL have received no refund,1
2022,"AWFUL. It makes you sign in every single time you open the app, and sometimes even in the middle of shopping. It constantly crashes.",1
2021,Not able to use anymore. Always has errors once you start looking at items. Goes through menus until you want to view results and then nothing.,1
2023,"App is glitchy. Asks me to sign in every other time I use it and isn't compatible with Samsung Pass (password manager). Has issues loading often. Have tried clearing cache, un, and reinstalling multiple times without luck.",2
2023,"Uninstalled after several attempts. The page never loads and when it does, has error messages. So useless, slower than the browser.",1
2023,It seems they have made it impossible to filter boy or girls clothes. Everything is listed as gender neutral making shopping for my 4 year old girl and my six month old boy take way to long as I can't filter things out for the gender I'm not interested. So frustrating!,2
2021,"Old navy always has great prices and fantastic clearance. I can't believe I used to think it was a stuffy store for boring mom clothes! I've found such great deals for myself and my kids. Honestly I prefer the styles to other kid stores like carters, old navy has stylish clothes but in tiny kid sizes. 10/10!",5
2021,I hate this new app and I'm a regular old navy app shopper. Others have already posted about the search functionality lacking and the scrolling returning all the way back to the top of the product list. You can't search jeans by type anymore and I can't access any of my previous orders even when I'm logged in. I truly hate this app,1
2023,Update 7/23/23- App continues to freeze and be unreliable. Even the Shein app runs better than Old Navy. Please please fix this app! Unreliable. App will freeze and go blank most days. Better off using the website.,1
2023,"If I click on something on the email or even on the app, it will tell me access denied. If it is an online only sale, I am left out since I can't get to the sale. It would be nice if you could fix this issue.",1
2021,"Had to download, AGAIN the useless upgraded app, changed my password twice. That's something I particularly hate. Can't sign into old or new accounts. Horrible ""UPDATES!"" It shouldn't be this irritating or difficult to spend $ on your app",1
2023,Shuts app down when I try to log in.,1
2021,"Ever since the new app came out, it is useless. It constantly says something went wrong and to refresh, but that doesn't work. I'll change my rating when the app starts working right.",1
2023,so far the items that i bought fits perfect for me and good quality..,4
2022,"Way too glitchy. Stalls (spinning wheel of death) constantly. Always getting ""something went wrong"" error. This app operates really amateur for it being an extension of such a large brand.",1
2022,"This app is awful! It is slow, a lot of times doesn't let me filter by size and always makes me go thru the play store to update/open the app every time I open the app.",1
2023,I am a plus size woman who always looks pulled together wearing Old Navy linen pants & my fav vneck t's. Ty Old Navy.,5
2021,The app was very glitchy. It is very glitchy and the error message kept popping up when I wanted to check on my orders. It's very frustrating so I decided to delete the app.,1
2022,"I like the interface of the app and features available, however loading times have never improved even with update after update. I'm starting to really hate this app no matter how good the deals are.",2
2023,The app is literally unusable. I have a pixel 6 and cannot load anything in the app. Shopping in my browser with an extremely slow internet connection is much faster than the app.,1
2023,"It displays ""Something went wrong"" almost every time I try to use it. On the rare occasion it works, it brings you back to the top of the page every time you look at an item. Basically useless.",1
2021,"App does work... used to, but now it only shows errors. At least the desktop version works. Hopefully they figure out what is going on! I love me some Old Navy!",2
2022,Always has been and looks like they might always will be my favorite store. It's always great when you can get yourself and your hubby both looking good without having to go to 2 separate stores. Lol. Love This Place. I ask for Old Navy Gift Cards Every Year For Christmas.,5
2022,After signing in it kept asking me to sign in again. Finally could shop and it suddenly wouldn't let me add to cart or see my cart. So I checked for updates and updated. Same problems. Seems like thisnis always broken.,1
2023,Changed my review from 4 stars to 2. Every time I open the app now it doesn't load all the way. Can't browse anything. It also keeps telling me to update it but I don't have any updates available. I like Old Navy but this app needs improvement!,2
2022,"Stupid policy. Can't use Super Cash unless you spend $125. I had $50 to redeem and I couldn't. Will continue to shop at kohls from now on. I get 40% off coupons all the time, plus kohls cash that can be combined + no minimum spending. Old navy...you suck.",1
2022,"Old Navy has Always been a go to store to get clothes I need for certain things growing up. occasions, school pants, work pants, etc were all covered and I still love coming either in the store or looking online now. Old Navy will always be a part of me for a very long time. ????",5
2022,"I have so much trouble trying to pay my bill I've tryed everything in ur infromation I log in an it won't take user ID password, then try to change it, dont work, I tryed guess pay that didnt work.. I will not charge any more because there are late fee added.",1
2022,"Ever since this recent update app is super slow, often times just spins. Just went through and marked a bunch of items in to my favorites only to have the app tell me I have nothing saved in favorites.",2
2022,"I did love this app,still on phone,but for months,have to log in,then,goes right back to say log in?I'd is correct etc,just have to do it twice,anddd then white pop up with there promotional stuff,yet no way to x it close??EVERY SINGLE TIME!Finally have to give up and try to get online and start all over again,frustrating! ended up ,repeatedly, to put my sons addy in,redo,paypal,3x's,ends up,NOT sending through the one with ,this is a gift,or HB,etc,and puts my name,his addy?MG!",3
2021,"This ""new"" app is constantly giving me the error ""something went wrong"" I have to use a web browser for almost everything. Too many issues. It's up to date. Why were we forced to install this ""new version?""",2
2022,Old Navy is inclusive with everyone. All body sizes. They are very true blue with who they are and have so much to choose from. I'm an older woman and absolutely love their fashion sense.,5
2022,"The App lags a lot, constantly makes me log in and doesn't even bring up my account. There's no point in having the app when I still have to open a web page to actually use it.",1
2023,Super glitched. It's almost unusable.,1
2022,"I'm always getting ""something went wrong"" every time I attempt to checkout. I have to complete my purchases on the Old Navy website. I mean, what is the point of having the app when it doesn't work? Deleting if it doesn't get fixed.",3
2022,This app is basically useless for anything except pestering you with notifications. Glitches constantly and doesn't even save my log in. Just use the mobile site (which is also pretty bad tbh but at least the pages load).,1
2021,"Was working fine for a while. I don't know what happened, I've tried about 50 times to use it this last week and I keep only getting the ""Oops. Something is wrong, try refreshing"" no matter what I try & click to. Pretty annoying actually.",1
2022,Slow! I'm constantly having to close the app and go back in to get it to work. It's always buffering or an error message comes up saying to try again.,2
2022,"Edit: luckily they fixed what i was initally frustrated with but now it keeps kicking me out of my account right after logging in taking me back to the login page or sometimes it wont let me log in at all. Also wont let me edit my cart which means i cant check out, very annoying!",1
2021,Havent used app in a while. So I updated app today when prompted and now all I get is SOMETHING WENT WRONG. I certainly won't buy anything if I can't search for it or see any items. I used to have no issues.,1
2023,"ordered 2 tshirt and this was my second attempt they cancelled my orders because there was fraud.. i dont have time to call them and talk to them the reason why they cancelled on me. if you dont want my money, ill take my services elsewhere",1
2022,"The app is very glitchy. I have to sign in over and over again when I'm browsing, and now it won't even let me check out. It keeps saying something went wrong and to refresh, but that does not work.",1
2021,Have been shopping here for my kid since he was born. He is now 12 and is wearing men sizes and doesn't really like shopping any where else. Now that they have expanded in plus sizes I have been shopping for myself at Old Navy. Thank you Old Navy!,5
2022,When it works it's fine. App logs you out constantly but doesn't actually log you out so it just sits there continously trying to load. You have to log yourself out and relog in every time to get it to work,1
2023,has a lot of bugs and freezes.,3
2022,"I love their flip flops and try to order as many as I can at the first part of spring and then I have a new pair any time I need one all summer long. I also love the styles, I will be 50 years old this year but I don't look my age and Old Navy keeps me from looking like the old lady that I am!",5
2022,"Takes forever to load even with 5G, somwtime it doesn't load at all. Constantly having to sign in, even while active in the app. Honestly, the app is useless. You're better off just going to the website.",1
2021,Typically I love Old Navy and buy everything there. The buyers must be on break or something bad has happened. There is nothing in the store that anyone over 19 would wear. And what happened to girl's clothing? infant stuff is still adorable. But size 5 to 12 is embarrassing. Get it together ON buyers. We need you.,2
2023,"Old Navy carries ""Plus Sizes"" in practically everything ""women's""",5
2022,I love the real sizes for women and most of the prices and fast delivery. I don't like the amount of cropped shirts and blouses. The crop tops do not look good on real American sized women. that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.,4
2021,"Every page says ""something went wrong"" . Completely unusable. Won't load any product through searches or browsing departments. Just shows error message.",1
2021,"Old Navy has a great selection of girls tops and jeans and low prices too! My daughter is tall and slim and the Ballerina style fits perfect. This is our ""go to"" store for back to school!",5
2022,Was prompted to update the app and now I keep getting errors that something went wrong when I try to look in each category. My bank account thanks you because now I can't shop and I have no plans to drive to the nearest store; it's cold outside.,1
2021,"I can't shop with this app. No matter what I do or click on it always says ""Something went wrong"" then tells me to refresh when the refresh button somes absolutely nothing to solve the problem. Please fix so I can continue my shopping ??!",1
2023,So glitchy. It doesn't even load half the time.,1
2023,I would give the app a 0 if I could. And I will be deleting this app. It just doesn't work.,1
2021,Wish when you hit the back button thw app would take you back to the item you were browsing instead of back to the top of the page. Otherwise it's a good retail app.,4
2023,"I love ON, but the app is trash. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Links from outside sources do not open in the app and navigation in the app is extremely slow and makes it unusable.",1
2021,"Best deals for women and children! I have a toddler about to turn 2 years old and these deals are AAAHHHMMMAZING ! Our kids grow so fast, so it's nice to find clothes that are amazing quality with a great price tag!",5
2021,"I thought the old app was bad, but this was another fail. For a big company why are their apps so bad? This one LOOKS streamlined but there's no rhyme or reason. When I go to girls clothes, I want to see girls clothes. They used to have gender neutral on it's own tab. It took 25 minutes to find 1 pair of girls overall shorts and they're $32? Lol ok.",1
2022,Awful app! It rarely loads and when it does it glitches. I always end up going to the website which can be an inconvenience at times.,1
2022,Items take a while to load in good service areas and the app has asked me to log back into my account multiple times per visit. I'm always logged out every time I open the app. It's exhausting.,2
2022,"Love love LOVE it ?? all the best style for my son. I don't do any shopping here for me, but children's clothes are priced SO LOW sometimes. Can't best those prices! App works great. No ads that I can remember. Ok. I'm done here I've gotta go winter shopping for the kiddo ??",5
2022,"Just an ok app. When I click on special sales notifications it does not load content. I keep getting ""Something went wrong"" error when I click on shop then gender category.",2
2021,"New update crashes! ""Oops, something went wrong"" error message and then shuts down. Even when I click on sales alerts, this error happens.",1
2023,Have to re-download everytime I want to use the app because it says there is an update available when there isn't. So I end up having to delete the app and then install it again. Annoying!,1
2021,I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this app is always giving me errors. I just tried to check out with a large purchase of jeans and t-shirts and it gave me an error and emptied my cart. So I gave up on the purchase.,1
2021,"I have an android....this app is unusable. Despite the updates, uninstalling and reinstalling it just says ""oops something went wrong"" every time. Can't shop if it won't load!",1
2021,App crashes as soon as I login. I've Uninstaller and reinstalled and app keeps crashing. Can't look let alone shop! POS new app! SO FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW! Only gave it one star because I can't give it zero stars!,1
2022,Having lots of issues with sign requiring me to sign in multiple times and pages not loading. I just ran the update and not resolved. I gave up and do it on website (no issues there).,1
2022,"i love their sales and styles, however, the app is always terrible w connection and loading. no matter where I'm at, when I see a sale pop up, I'll click into the app to check the sales, and it just won't load properly.",3
2021,"Doesn't work - I don't know what they did but I continuously get ""Something Went Wrong"" notifications any time I try to open a different page. No items load and the app is currently useless.",1
2022,"App is junk! Constantly telling me ""something went wrong"" when I try to look at the clothes. I try pressing try again over and over and nothing. This happens everytime I try to use the app; might as well just use the website.",2
2021,"For a few months now, each time I go to look at items it says ""something went wrong"" and it won't load items to looks at. I primarily can only see what the sales are and then ha e to go to the website to shop",2
2023,"Crashes and never loads. There's always an error and come back later message. They really need to fix this, it makes shopping impossible.",1
2023,"The app has been terrible for so long now. Nothing ever loads, when you try to log in you get an error message. Impossible to shop with the app. Takes me 20 min just to load a page.",1
2023,App hasn't loaded for days. At this point I'm probably go to delete it for good.,1
2021,"Wallet won't allow me to login to my account. I contacted OldNavy directly who advised, they didn't have an IT to assist. If updating and reinstalling doesn't work they can't do anything and I just can't use...",1
2022,"Has never worked properly, and we're taking YEARS. Doesn't load, can't open categories, constantly requires upgrades that just make it worse. I don't understand how it's possible to be this bad.",1
2022,"The app is super buggy. It takes forever to load pages, you have to sign in each time you open the app, and it constantly crashes.",2
2022,Any time I get a test message from old navy or see cute clothes in an add online and it redirects me to the app it doesn't load anything. If I try and search on the app it doesn't load anything. How am I supposed to shop for clothes if I don't get to see or find what you have?? This app is just trash,1
2021,"The home page will load perfect but every time I click to shop a department, it says ""Something went wrong, refresh to try again"". Very annoying.",1
2022,"The app is very user friendly, however sometimes it does crash during checkout. I've had no choice but to log in using the website to compete purchases.",3
2023,Unable to view charges and pay bill through app.,1
2022,I have had troubles with this app for the past two months. I keep waiting for an update and nothing. It just loads forever and I can't do any online shopping. Before that as well I would always be signed out.,2
2021,"I don't like that you can no longer view only the section you want. If I only want to see shirts in women's plus size, I have to now also view everything under women's plus size... Before you had options. Jeans, shirts, shorts etc;",1
2021,"I have android. You CANNOT log in on the app. It places the ""login"" button over the field for password so you cannot access the field. I have requested help, zero response. Unfortunate cause it keeps me from shopping there.",1
2023,"After years of being over weight, I am now able to shop here and LOVE it!!",5
2022,"Android version needs help. Never keeps me logged in. Regularly a ""something went wrong"" message. Pages don't load. Doesn't save favorites. Very frustrating.",1
2023,The app doesn't load when I get to search for something. It just shows the searching symbol when you try to search. And then i can't move past that. I can't see pictures or order,1
2021,"When I view an item and return to the list view, the app takes me back to the beginning. So I have to scroll all the way down to where I left off. Super frustrating!",3
2022,I love the products and the fact that I can shop for my whole family in one spot. I HATE THE APP!! It's pure TRASH??! Every time I attempt to go into the app it sends me to the App store and I have to access the app through the App store ???????.,1
2023,"My favorites never save. The app takes forever to load, and sometimes it says the stuff saved on my favorites are sold out when they're still in stock. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option. I'm on a Galaxy S21",1
2023,"Disgusting app experience,keeps crashing, closing itself mid browsing, keeps going to the top of search. Just horrible, fix it.",1
2023,"Once I updated as ""required"", my ""wallet"" will not update the current balance/statement. Phone calls to the number on the back of my card was not helpful nor was the on-line chat. Thinking about cancelling my card since payment on-line will never happen for me",1
2023,"Terrible app, finally uninstalled. It crashes constantly, pages don't load, etc. Literally unusable. I'm trying to give you money, please make a better app.",1
2023,"The app literally never works. It doesn't load. And if it does, the next time you click on something... it doesn't. There are so many times I've wanted to buy something from the app, but it doesn't end up working. So I just move on with my day, not making any purchase.",1
2023,"The app is VERY glitchy. It constantly tells me something went wrong. I was expecting this to be fixed with the latest update, but it wasn't. Looks like I'll have to stick to using the website.",1
2023,"I click on app and it sits and travels, it won't completely load. I try to update as pop up requests, but no update installs- still won't load. Is it the same app if it shows a circle emblem as the square emblem with rounded corners?",3
2023,Have to call them then all of a sudden my correct balance shows up. If I do not call then it lags and doesn't update.,1
2023,"I haven't even been able to get to the sign in page, it's just a loading or error page. I'd love to shop with the app but it's literally unusable.",1
2023,This app never wants to load its always signing me out for no reason. This is supposed to be a easy way to shop instead its been frustrating trying to get it to load anything.,1
2023,"too much polyester, not enough cotton :(",3
2023,The app lags so much and can be extremely frustrating to use. It's often easier to browse their website versus using the app.,2
2021,"New and improved would be great if it were true. I have been absolutely unable to use the app at all, because nothing loads, since I installed it. Just keeps telling me that something went wrong.",1
2021,"Your app sucks, I tried creating an account through the app and it wouldn't let me. Kept giving an error without saying a reason for it. Everything was put in correctly including password and still nothing.",1
2023,sizes are not available most of the time,3
2021,"will not retain ""My Favorites""? ever. 20% of the time I can't even pull up the ""View Cart"", either. Old Navy: this isn't good for business if ppl can't even check out their items. They'll get annoyed & check out another store's site/app Note8 Fix this--not cool :(",3
2022,"love old navy, the app could use some work. everytime I try to ""save for later"" from my cart it brings me back to the sign in page even though I'm already signed in. I have to actually delete the item instead of saving it.",2
2023,great deals great clothes for all ages!,5
2021,"This app is great except for the fact that when you click on an item for details and then go back to the results page, it doesn't bring you back to the same spot. You have to scroll down again through all of the items to get back to where you were.",4
2023,This app is useless. Feels like it works less than half the time,2
2023,So after all the complains about this app lagging and lack of functioning; nothing has been done about it but I'm sure Old Navy/Gap make millions of dollars and y'all still can't even fix your app?! I can't even pay my bill on the app which would be most convenient. Get it together Old Navy!!!!,1
2021,I love there Jean's I've been shopping here for 5 years specifically for there Jean's I know which styles I love and for online shopping it makes it so much easier I don't have to worry about getting the wrong sizes. recently got the credit card they charged my card without me knowing and when I tried to call the lady was not helpful at all,5
2023,its been glitchy for so long now & am now having a hard time opening the app????,1
2023,Always takes forever to load....never works properly for me.,1
2022,"It keep up latest looks with fair prices and also, have a lot in my size. Yet, some items are still being displayed in stocks but no longer on sale or discontinued due limit supply.",4
2022,It's not as easy to navigate and features will sometimes not work properly. EDIT: since update 2 days ago the app keeps crashing.,2
2022,This app glitches more often than it works. Even upon checkout (I want to buy your product!) It tells me something went wrong and to try again later. I've never had such a hard time giving someone my money.,1
2022,Old Navy app is the worst app I've ever had. I can't believe that with the years it's getting worst and worst. So disappointed. I love Old Navy but trying to buy or make a payment in this app it's a nightmare. It's a shame They haven't improved it for better.,1
2021,"Pages won't load. App opens, then I click a category and ""something went wrong"" pops up and none of the categories load. I use to use this app to shop and now I can't. I have a reward I cant use on the website. Fix this Old Navy.",1
2022,"Terrible, constantly not working, makes you re- login every time, no great features, takes you back to the top of the page when you view an item",1
2023,great savings on school clothes for the grandchildren.,5
2021,This app crashes every time I try to open it. Then it won't let me just go to the website to shop. What the heck Old Navy!?! I expected the app to be a 5 star and it's not even a 1 star but thats the lowest rate I can give. So disappointed in it.,1
2021,I can not redeem my supercash and I have to login so many times is annoying and frustating. On Sunday i added clothes to purchase but on Monday was not working. I'm trying to purchase back to school clothing but I can not there is nothing on my app everything was erased. I'm not a happy customer. Not even on the website works.,1
2022,One of the worst shopping apps I have ever used. Hardly functions and logs out constantly then refuses to log back in. It makes shpping impossible and a huge waste of time.,1
2023,this app makes it so easy for me to find the product my family needs.,5
2022,"Can't update the cart. Won't let me save items for later, or delete them out of cart. When I try I get a spinning dial then nothing. Have tried logging out then in but I still have this problem on the app.",3
2023,"love the styles,and all my jeans I purchase at Old Navy.Great!!!!",5
2022,Still love the clothes but can't use the app at all! It doesn't work anymore. I can open it and it loads and loads with nothing else happening. I have to go through my emails to shop,3
2021,"Fix your app if you want anyone to use it.. every time I try to use it it sends me to download the app.. I already have the app.. then, I cannot even browse without an error.. ***update!!!! Still never bothered to fix it.. uninstalled",1
2023,App runs slow and glitches a lot.,1
2022,Really easy to use and navigate. I like that saved items will be automatically included in a sale discount if it's eligible.,5
2023,clothes are made of good quality and great value,5
2023,The app is always glinching and never wants to load.,1
2023,Doesn't work said invalid username or password can enter website just fine with same username password,1
2022,"How can you order anything when the pages do not load??? Horrible app, should never have changed from the blue logo. Was hoping to get some Christmas shopping done but unfortunately it will not be through Old Navy.",1
2022,"This app used to be great, but now I'm constantly having to sign in while I'm using it and each page takes forever to load, if it loads at all. Very disappointing. I can't even shop with the app anymore.",2
2021,"App won't work. I've had it downloaded since it came out as the new/updated app, and it's always had errors. It won't load at all.",1
2023,bad app and platform but Great Deals & offers recomended old navy store,5
2022,"The Jeans are amazing... The fit is Always true and for Over 20 years I have been a faithful customer, earning an ""ICON"" shopper status! Only COMPLAUNT I have, is with new bank (Barklays) that secures your Old Navy card. I have NEVER had So Much Trouble trying to access my own account! Such Exasperation! It's a Real Good thing that I love the clothes!!",5
2023,Stalls often shows store available items that are not available,2
2022,"I can't sign in. I've tried uninstalling, restarting my Android Pixel 6. Pretty big fail if you can't even sign in. I can't find any help for this issue anywhere. No one at a retail store could help either, that's how desperate I am.",1
2023,I like the store but the app is hard to order with.,4
2023,"Does not load, even after being updated",1
2023,Good place to shop i love it,5
2021,Something Went Wrong error makes using the app impossible. Used to use the app to shop regularly. Now I can't use it at all. It has been this way for quite a while now with no resolution. Just uninstalled the app with no intention of trying to use it again.,1
2023,"Too many glitches! Awful, can't even pay my bill",1
2023,"love the app & the clothes,also great deals ????.",5
2023,I had to uninstall. It hasn't been loading any screen in the app at all since I downloaded it a few months ago.,1
2023,Super glitchy and doesn't load.,1
2023,The app literally doesn't work for anyone anymore its broken and it sucks,1
2023,"Too slow!! Please, fix it!",1
2021,"Only complaint is that when you are browsing and click on an item when you click back, instead of bringing you to the same spot it takes you back to the top of the page. Unlike the web browser. So you have to scroll alllll the way back down.",4
2021,"Every time I try opening the app it says ""Oops, something went wrong"". This has been going on ever since the app was updated a few months ago. I am going to unninstall the app and try using the website to order.",1
2023,I love their jeans and flannels!!!,5
2023,one app to rule them all!,5
2023,Thank u for sale.,4
2023,The only store I shop at ??????,5
2023,"Literally every time I order to pick up at my local store, it's canceled, but only after I'm on my way to get the order. I'll never make that mistake again. Bye.",2
2023,Always freezes and logs you out randomly,1
2021,Needs better filtering & if I hit back from looking at an item it should not jump back to the top of the page. Definitely not an upgrade from the previous app.,1
2022,"I have a Samsung S10. Just updated this app, can't login now. When I click LOGIN it just says LOADING and eventually times out. I see a lot of others are having trouble with checking out since July....why hasnt this new update been fixed??",1
2021,You can't log. It's so annoying because the words covering the password and username doesn't allow you to click and enter info....fix this so people are able to order online.,1
2022,I sign in then touch an item that I want and it takes me back to the sign in page. Once that happens it keeps saying error and refresh. Worthless app.,1
2022,"It used to work great but with the recent upgrade it never keeps my login with biometrics, and constantly says error when I do login. But the website lets me login with 0 issues.",2
2022,"Will only show me the main screen. When I try to open anything, it'll load forever and will never let me access or see anything but a white screen. Super annoying!",2
2021,"App is unusable. I get the ""Something went wrong... Refresh and try again"" message every time I open the app and attempt to navigate to literally anything. Please fix!",1
2023,Shopping at Old Navy since 1998!,5
2021,This app sucks! Made several attempts to login to pay my bill and I keep receiving error message. It also kept telling me that my password was incorrect.,1
2021,"It's an okay app. There's fewer filters when searching for items, and occasionally it freezes.",4
2021,This app does not work. Everytime I try to go to the page to check balance or pay. The auto lagy pops up to talk. If I close it I lose the page. It's is horrible,1
2021,"I really like the new app! But when I click on an item and I want to go back to continue scrolling through, it goes all the way up to the top. Super annoying! Can this please be fixed. I hate trying to find my spot again.",2
2022,"horrible app. it will constantly ask you to log in, lose what you've saved in your cart, and freeze on you. only thing I enjoy about it is the pick up option.",2
2022,Having to log in every 10 seconds is getting old. Uninstalling the app. Thought it would make shopping easier instead it's a nightmare,1
2022,"Always I get this message when trying to search and use the filter ""Something went wrong, Uh Oh!"" It's basically a useless app. THIS APP is now the WORST app I've experienced in life. Bottom of the barrel on this one guys.",1
2022,The app is very slow and refuses to load. You are better off getting in your car and driving to an Old Navy faster than the web pages load.,1
2022,Love this store but the app is so so annoying. It's so inconsistent. One day it works the other out glitches and i uninstaled and then reinstalled the app but still doesn't wanna load.,3
2021,"I have not been able to use this app for months. I have no idea how they haven't come out with an update to fix it. Every time I try to load anything, it just says ""Something went wrong."" It seems apparent that Old Navy doesn't care enough to have a working app for Android users",1
2021,This app is frustrating! If you're looking at the details of something you shouldn't have to start over at the top when you exit. I was going to buy quite a few things but I couldn't stand to use it so...,1
2021,New app is taking much longer to get used too it is confusing when searching and adding codes. Adding my ON card perks code is more difficult and takes a few tries. Preferred old app and not liking this new one.,3
2021,"App sucks. Can't get pages to load, error. Home page loads fine but when I click on a department category I get the error. App is unusable. ????",1
2022,"Constantly logs you out, requiring to add password everytime and cannot view the cart and refresh does not work. The app is useless if we cannot add to the cart or view it.",1
2021,"The new app is a POS. It always has issues. Can't shop using it, I have to go to the browser. Which takes away the point of having a app if it's useless. Bring the old one back.",1
2021,"I love old navy but I absolutely hate that they don't give free shipping to card members. spending $50 to earn free shipping is high. while I like the clothes they don't last long, they also tend to shrink so I size up.",3
2021,The new app wucks the only reason I have it is to pay my credit card and there is no way to navigate to it. SUPER FRUSTRATING. paying off my catd and cutting ut up. Done with this store.,1
2021,"Looking at any item is frustrating when ever you hit back to view more it jumps to the top, making you start over. I had to give up.",2
2021,"Terrible since the upgrade. I have deleted and reinstalled it multiple times and I still get the ""something went wrong"" error every time.",1
2021,Initially this app has been working great. All of a sudden the app closes out. Unable to use. Will change the stars once app starts back working...,1
2022,"Horrible app.. it's all blank white pages, and if something does show it is telling me I need to refresh the page. App has been like this for a while now. Please fix this.",1
2021,"Won't work. It opens but every time I try to click to shop on something I get an error message telling me to refresh. But no matter how many time I hit refresh, it still doesn't work.",1
2022,I haven't been able to open the app in days. It's just stuck loading and I can't look at anything. It also logs me out of my account every time I close it and it's a huge pain to log back in.,1
2021,"Customer update: the app has not worked since last update. Very disappointed. Isn't working, I can't pay on my credit card. I haven't shipped on this one yet, but I don't have very high hopes",1
2021,"Was good, except kept showing the same items, just in a different color. But, now I can't login. The line to put in my password is not visible.",3
2021,"Seriously with the scrolling! i think this is the most inconvienent frustrating shopping app ive ever had. Scrolling to find an item, look at the item and be forced to start ALLLLLLL over back at the top... ugghh id rather just not.",1
2021,"App was easy to use. I wish that when you went out from looking at an item, it would return back to where you were the page instead of the top.",3
2021,If I click on something in my search and then go back it starts me all the way at the top and I have to search for where I was on the page. So frustrating I'd rather just look on the web or not at all. Please fix,2
2021,"New app is terrible, doesn't even work. It constantly tells me to refresh for my rewards then says it's not working....it's been doing this for over two weeks.",1
2022,"Will not let me sign in?? I've un-installed and reinstalled multiple times and it repeatedly says oops something went wrong unable to log in try refreshing. Refreshing doesn't work either, it just times out.",1
2022,"This app never seems to work correctly. Sometimes it will not load pages and is so slow. I've given up ordering numerous times. Do better, ON!",1
2021,"This new app does not work on my android phone. The app says something went wrong and regardless of how many times I refresh, I cant move past the error.",1
2021,"Garbage, keeps going back to the main old navy loading page. Can't access the factory shop for gap or banana republic. Bring back the old app or get better developers that actually understand UI/UX.",1
2021,I give Old Navy 5 stars for affordability and delivery. 1 star for the online shopping. I find it shady that there is no apparent way to redeem old navy cash on the computer website. I have to use the app on my phone to take advantage of the cash I've earned,5
2022,"Love ON and their clothes, used to love the app too. But recently I'm unable to sign in and add things to the cart. Hopefully they'll push out another update and I can go back to shopping!",1
2022,"It keeps making me sign in due to ""inactivity"" but it has made me sign in twice in the same sitting before. I also don't like that I have to sign in to try take a closer look at products, which wouldn't be an issue if I could just STAY SIGNED IN",2
2022,Slow. Everytime I open the app I have to log in. It won't log me in a lot of the time. I usually always have errors and I get frustrated so I just visit the website.,3
2021,"Frustrating to scroll through hundreds of images, click on one and then when you return to the list it puts you back at the top!!",3
2022,"Old Navy has tons of pretty clothes, but I wish they wouldn't change their sizing/styles so soon. Many of their tops are now too short for me to wear which is a bummer because I really like their stuff.",4
2022,"Everytime I go to do anything with checking out or putting clothes in my ""saved for later"", it tells me to log in... I log in, takes me to the check out, put a item in saved for later, have to log in AGAIN. I've done this over 10x already.",2
2022,The current app is not good. I'm constantly logged off and have difficulty logging back in. There should be a way to empty the entire cart at one time. Cannot believe such a major company has such a bad app.,2
2022,"I like the quality of the clothes but the app has some glitches. I have to log in every single time I want to use it, if I leave the app to answer a message, I have to log in again even though I was out for just 2 minutes. It annoys me.",3
2021,"I love this store, but for the last few weeks the app doesn't work. As soon as I try to open it, it closes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times with no success. Very annoying",1
2021,"Love the styles, app is easy to use, you get rewarded for buying things you love, they accept Afterpay so you can break your purchases down into 4 easy payments! Amazing ??",5
2023,Team Old Navy! I absolutely love that have clothes not only thin women but plus size women as well! they clothes lasts forever! I have been shopping at Old Navy for years and will continue shopping there!!,5
2023,"The app refuses to let me select a category (men, women, girls...) and keeps telling me there is an error and I need to refresh. So much for an ""update"". I'm try online vs the app.",2
2021,"Completely confusing....who was the wizard that came up with this? Isn't the point to have LESS CLICKS to get where you're going??? I'm clicking everything....still can get to my destination. Poor, very poor!",1
2023,This app sucks. Half the time it tells me something went wrong. When it does work it is so slow I usually just give up. Also it doesn't keep me signed in. Get it together Old Navy! I'm over it.,1
2021,On my Samsung 21s you think you've opened the app but haven't. One must open account then sign in. Signing in should pop up first every time. And the tracking of rewards NEVER works. Have to keep paper,2
2021,"I can't sign in to my account using the ""Sign in"" button. The sign in screen is over lapping with text. Anywhere I tap to guess at where I enter my username-nothing happens.",4
2021,"Been shopping at Old Navy since 2002. Always satisfied with great assistance at every location. Even though I won't be approved for the ON credit card, I will always be a loyal customer!!!",5
2022,"This app is not working! I get an update available message and try to update but it won't. I have also tried to make a payment and I am unable to...it caused my payment to be late ?? In conclusion, this app sucks.",1
2022,"For some reason, every time I open this app it tells me I have to go to google play before I can use the app. I thought maybe a few updates would help but it's still happening. It's incredibly annoying.",2
2021,"DO NOT allow the update it comes with nothing but glitches. The same goes for the Old Navy Credit Card site, it's so glitchy that you have to try MULTIPLE times to simply pay your bill..",1
2021,"It hasn't worked for literal months. Every time I try to actually shop, it says ""Something Went Wrong"". Nothing but the home screen loads. What's the point of having an app that doesn't even work?",1
2022,"Don't order from Old Navy, Gap, or Banana Republic. They WILL sell your personal info and there is **no way to opt out**. Enjoy endless calls and scam emails that will make it through your filter due to it being part of their ""subscription"" you never opted into.",1
2023,No matter how much I update app it's so buggy. Looking thru clothes it without clicking anything takes me all the way back to the top. Over and over. Maybe it's a sign a shouldn't buy anything!,1
2021,"I cannot search anything ""Something Went Wrong"" pops up on every search. Even when I try to go by department and category the same error message comes up.",1
2021,need better selection online. It's sad when the only women's jeans that are ever on here are skinny jeans. there are a lot of women that don't like that look. Old Navy was one of the few places I could find jeans that fit me right. Very disappointed.,1
2022,"I love ?? this app! I shop here all the time and I am so happy with all my purchases. I hope they keep doing it right, I'm a plus size girl and all the selection is awesome. I look and feel great in all old navy??",5
2021,"Love Old Navy, need better consistency on sizing....I'm the same size and I order the same size but sometimes what I order feels 2 sizes smaller. More variety of clothes would be great too.",4
2022,Log in is a nightmare. I have had the same password for an over a year. Every time I try to log in is it rejected until I reset it.,3
2022,I most shop online. Love ON and the fab sales. I think their clothes have improved since my daughter worked at Old Navy in Lincoln City. Love the vintage sweatshirts. I have every color now. Please make some different colors.,5
2022,"The app rarely loads, doesnt save login information, and crashes regularly. Whomever works for the development team may need some overtime for training.",1
2022,I love that they have options for talls for women's pants and are affordable. I took away one star because the app on phone is buggy and does not display well at all and hard to look at maternity options,4
2021,Worst app ever can't get old orders can't look up anything can't pay bill. They need to go back to old user it worked much better than this knew one. Might have to cancel card because app is just horrible.,1
2021,It shuts down every few minutes. I have to enter my password every time to get back in. Every time I view a product and go back it doesn't go back to where I was it goes back to the top of page and you have to scroll down through everything again to get back to where you were.,2
2022,Can't sign into my account on the app. All the words are overlaying the password area. Used the email on the app info to find out it's not valid. Very disappointed.,1
2021,"The updated app is TERRIBLE! There is so many things wrong with it, it's hard to even describe or list them all. It was better before it was updated a few days ago. I hope it gets figured out soon as it's making it hard to shop/use.",2
2022,"Extremely glitchy. Takes forever for pages to load if they do at all. I'm using the website 99% of the time anyway, so I'll probably just uninstall it.",2
2023,Again i placed an order.never got an email or notification from app. item was at the store. store didnt notify me. Item was returned ...bad app bad business.... Please fix your app so that we can pay bills and see orders. What is the point,1
2021,"By far one of my favorite stores, and the deals are unchallenged. I can also say that I have always had a good experience when returning items. 10/10 would recommend ??",5
2022,I 100%hate this app every time I have to pay my bill Ithey seem to be updating the app and I can never log in to pay it I'm not paying a late fee for their stupidity wake up Old Navy and read your reviews. I'm seriously considering cancelling this card for this reason only.,1
2021,"I have to agree with everyone else. The app is almost great, but it's pretty annoying to have to start at the top of the product when you go back from a product page.",2
2021,This app sucks. Won't let me upload my card. Won't let me upload my paypal. Having problems saving my info. So can't buy anything. Tried installing and reinstalling. Just keeps refreshing. Don't bother downloading,1
2022,"Something is wrong with the App. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Its updated to the current version. I can't checkout. When I go to checkout, I get an error message asking me to refresh.",1
2021,"Never works, not user friendly AT ALL, and password reset fails every time. What kind of people make an app that doesn't work??!",1
2021,"Much better. No need to relogin to check rewards, orders, supercash while shopping. All is there. Additionally, the use of a gift card should not take away any members status for free shipping holding a navyist membership.",5
2021,The new updated app is terrible. It constantly doesnt work and gives error messages. Someone in web/app design should be canned. ??,1
2021,Can a leave no stars..... Jesus Christ! Theirs not even a tab to direct you to pay the credit card. The previous app was fine just the way it was. Change is great just not in this direction.,1
2022,"App takes forever to load. Crashes more often then works. I've tried deleting and redownloading, restarting my phone. Very frustrating",1
2022,"The app has so many glitches. The pages don't load properly, favorites are not being saved even though the item is in stock.",3
2022,"Old Navy never fails. New arrivals are always in the latest trends while staying in the ""Old Navy"" fashion. They never disappoint and the sizing have never altered.",5
2022,"Accidentally put a kids hoodie in my cart, won't let me delete it by hitting the delete button or even making the quantity 0. Tried deleting and reloading the app. Also can't figure out how to set up Autopay on this app. Not user friendly at all.",1
2023,"This app sooo glitchy. Love the deals, not loving the app. Edit: let me be more specific for the devs. I'm on an S21+ and I can't even put a second filter on there without getting a ""Something Went Wrong"" error.",2
2022,"Never had a problem returning anything, good customer service, I can use my Old Navy card at any of their stores, my go-to store if I need something quick. I never give five stars to leave room for improvements.",4
2021,Used app often until it began crashing as soon as it was launched! Tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app and nothing changed. Fix please!!,1
2023,2-3-23 and it still is AWFUL!!!! FIX YOUR FREAKING APP!!! Sucks. Tired of it not loading!! Update: 2 months later and it still sucks!!! Still not loading and I'm going to lose my super cash and rewards!!!!,1
2022,So many glitches.. the home page will hardly ever load and it signs me out over and over as I'm shopping. It makes it very frustrating sometimes so I just give up and don't even buy anything,2

2022,"I struggled with this app since June. So I had my husband download it on his Iphone, of course it worked fine. I think it's incredibly disappointing of old navy to be so inconsiderate for so long.",1
2021,"Sadly (according to my bank acct) I love the app, the ease and efficiency of use, the company's products, and their constant deals and discounts a little too much. :)",5
2021,"The app keeps crashing it doesnt even open up, I tap it and it flickers my screen back to its home page with all my other apps showing.",1
2022,"Literally the worst app on my phone. Load times take forever, have to sign in EVERYTIME I open a notification. The offers screen will not load going on 5 minutes at this point. Almost like they don't want you to shop......",1
2022,Good app and great store! Just one feedback: I have to sign in every time I click on the app. I would like to sign in just once and then be done with it.,5
2023,Impossible to shop on this app when it crashes constantly. Hit search to try and find something? Crashes. Try to select a section to shop in? Crashes.,1
2021,They honestly have the best clothing options I've seen. they grow with you or size down with you. quality is good and prices are even better! I can shop for the whole family at old navy!,5
2021,"I absolutely don't see any issues that these individuals are saying. Anyways love the app, way more snappier then before. A little more cleaner and yeah. Again a improvement that was much needed.",5
2021,The first time I tried to add something to my cart the app shut down completely & won't let me reopen. I uninstalled & reinstalled & the same thing happened again.,1
2023,This app is so glitchy and lags so much. Makes it so hard to shop. I just give up and don't buy anything. I refresh over and over and still get error messages. Do better Old Navy.,1
2021,It's about time! Hahaha!?? Super easy and smooth. Has all the functionality of the desktop version. The first purchase was great!,5
2021,When I tap on the app it brings me to the message about the new app to download. I have already done that. Then I just tap open. It does that every time. If I go through my email it doesn't have me do that.,1
2022,I LOVE Old Navy! I hate the app. It logs me out of my account and does not save my password. I need to do it again every time I open the app! Very frustrating!,3
2021,"I LOVE old navy but the app is horrible. Constantly freezes and ""something went wrong"" messages. The app worked decent until the last update.",1
2021,I downloaded the app because the website has a tendency to show unavailable pants even after you've filtered for your size. I guess it's just an Old Navy thing as the app reflected the same behavior. Smh.,1
2021,"Just uninstalled this app. After updates on 7/20, with the new setup of the app I can't see anything except the front page. Click on womens and see no items with an error message. Same with toddler girls, boys and mens, too.",1
2022,Errors since last update. Won't keep you logged in and constantly giving refresh errors. Need to get this fixed as you can't complete an order on the app currently,1
2022,"Since the last two updates, I can't even get any items to show at all. The spinning, buffering wheel just turns and silently laughs at all my attempts to window shop.",1
2022,"Always logs me off, constantly crashes, when I want to check out it gives me an error message and to try again later. I just started using the browser instead.",1
2023,Sometimes when I click on an item and try to go back it takes me all the way back to the top of the search and I have to find where I was. The app doesn't load often and I have to keep closing it and restarting it.,1
2021,Says it updated 4 days ago but have not been able to load things for a week+ nothing loads and can't be refreshed. Even when the app was working the app is clunky and not super great,1
2022,The app won't let me check out. It keep stating that something went wrong. I didn't have this issue with the older version. I keep the app updated so I don't understand the issue.,3
2021,"Unable to shop with new updates. It gives a landing page but when I click on a dept or picture, it errors out.",1
2021,Love the random sales and that options come in TALL!! Occasionally some different (strange) items and too many cropped! ;-),4
2023,"This is hands down the worst app I have used. It never works. You are never able to check out on it. There is always an error, it removes things from my cart, it never works.",1
2022,It's so glitchy and slow. I don't know what yall need to do to fix it but do it! Half the time I don't buy from old navy is because of this app. Other brands are able to have apps that do everything this app is supposed to do but better. Why is your app so slow and glitchy?,2
2023,"Takes forever to open when browsing, does not filter accordingly, goes back to the top of the page each time an item is viewed.",1
2022,"Will this app ever work again? I would love to take advantage of the current sales, use my rewards, etc. but the app never works! Can't sign in, can't use my points...I hate shopping in store because it's always a mess! Fix the app!",1
2022,"You can't update the cart. You can't update the quantity. You can't save fornlater. You can't delete an item from cart. I need to shop but the cart is stuck. I've updated all my other apps on device. I've logged out, logged in, still can't change the cart items.",1
2021,"Very poor app, at the sign page , can't allow to put password, the sign on tab is blocking the password tab. And won't let you do automatic payments.",2
2021,"After the last update the app is unusable. Just says ""something's wrong"". It was not user friendly before but now it's impossible.",1
2022,"Links to major categories don't work (girls just breaks every time it's clicked), doesn't keep you logged in (as in, logs you out of your account within minutes while shopping). Please hire people who have any clue at all about what they're doing. You're a major brand and this is just embarrassingly bad.",1
2021,"Updated the app 10/26/21 but now I can't search for anything or even view by category without getting the message ""Something went wrong"". Clicking Uninstall...",1
2021,"I have NEVER had a problem getting my Rockstar hi waisted stretch skinny jeans. Now I have been watching and checking the stores, on-line and my sister's store in Tyler. What is the problem. I have a lot of midrise but had to give away because of a really bad back and hi waisted don't cause me the pain and I can't buy them. After 6 mos of checking every other day I just now found them on line. Not good as I can only where your jeans the best.",2
2023,"Never loads properly, and when it does, it tells me I need to do an update. When I try to update it, it doesn't give the option to do so. It just gives the option to uninstall or open the app.",1
2022,"Why can't I purchase anything? Every time I put something in the cart, it says sorry there was a problem, ""refresh"". And I refresh and nothing changes. It's been like this for over a week for me. I've missed sales because of it.",1
2021,"Suddenly can't do certain features without receiving a refresh notice. Have been unable to checkout for a day now, really sucks.",2
2021,"Traded down for this app! There is no way to sort your search results?! If you look at an item and then go back, you go back to the TOP of the search results page?! AWFUL. Did you not test this app at all???",1
2021,"Their returns are AWFUL, seriously, absolutely terrible. But the clothes are good and decent quality, just return ASAP if you don't want it or if it doesn't fit.",2
2023,The app doesn't work and it's constantly crashing within 3 seconds of opening it. This app always had problems but this is ridiculous,1
2022,App is garbage. Nothing will load the blue floral shape thing just spins. I've tried several times over 2 days. Deleting the app.,1
2021,"Like some other reviews I'm unable to browse. Gives a generic ""uh oh something went wrong"" with a refresh button. Even if I wanted to use this app I literally can't. And it's also the only one to my knowledge that I use doing anything like this",1
2021,Filters don't work a lot of the time. I have to log into my account on the computer because it won't let me see my orders on app. Refreshing does no good.,3
2023,The app is extremely slow and sometimes doesn't load at all. The website has the same problem. Both definitely need some work!,2
2022,"SUCKS now! Every time you wanna actually buy anything you land in an endless loop of ""please sign in"" or ""oops something went wrong!"" or both. Apparently ON doesn't want any more of my money.",1
2021,Old navy is great especially when you can get ahold of items on sale. The discount allows us to get more for my 3 boys & otherwise would make it difficult. Most items & material are made well for my boys. Denim is great.,5
2022,"Can't even sign in without 'something went wrong. Please try again later'. Forever loading screen when I try to shop, even though my wifi is fine. Just not worth the headache.",1
2022,it's always a pleasure to shop Old Navy online. the process is easy and the styles are great. the deals are fantastic.,5
2021,App keeps shutting down. Definitely not user friendly when it finally works. This new app is not an improvement; it is much worse than the previous app.,1
2023,"Lately the app has not been functioning well, or is erratic and disrupts the shopping experience. I just give up and quit trying.",3
2021,"Need more jean options. There seems to be a limited amount of jean options, especially for men. Yes the summer screams shorts but nevertheless, there shouldn't be a shortage of jeans.",4
2022,"Old Navy has been the go to back to school shopping place for my family and I since I was a kid . Now, I get to shop for my kiddos with a brand that I can trust that's also affordable (gotta know when to hit those sales and thank you Old Navy for having them).",5
2022,Always have a hard time trying to pay ma card. Every month is the same. Always send my to dowthe app that is already downloaded. Right now I'm trying to do it is frustrating.,1
2021,"Why, oh why, do you go all the way back up to the top of the list every time you hit back after viewing an item? It would be such an easy fix to have it return to the item you were JUST viewing.",1
2022,"Great, unless you want to view things or place an order. It hangs often, making it virtually unusable. Go to the web site instead.",1
2021,"You can't even pay your card. Every time I either try to log in or to try to process a payment, it tells me something is wrong. I've even tried re entering everything but it doesn't work.",1

2022,The dresses this year have been incredible! I've amassed quite the collection. Now the just need to add some cute little embellished cardigans to go with them!!!,5
2022,This app does full stops and closes me out at times. There's always a new update for the app and it still seems to have too many glitches.,2
2022,"Too many issues. Makes you login over and over. Won't load searches, won't let you check out ""something went wrong "" error",1
2022,"The app crashes, images don't load, reviews don't show up at all. Pages buffer endlessly and I end up leaving the app to use a browser.",1
2022,I hate this janky app so much. So glitchy that it?s not even worth it to use ON Super Cash because attempting to navigate the app is too maddeningly annoying. Literally allowing Super Cash to expire rather than deal with this low-rent app.,1
2022,"This app never works right. Please fix major bugs. Sometimes I can't even open the app. It is always logging me out, even seconds after signing in.",1
2022,"Old Navy what are you doing to this app? Paypal is not working, codes are not applied, and every time I launch it tells me a nee version is available but I've already updated it! Not pleased with the changes at all! ????????",1
2022,"This app has constant issues. Won't load, error codes, randomly closing. I love Old Navy, but shopping in the app is a no go.",1
2022,"Always quality no matter what eventhough it's the lower brand of the Gap family. Plus, it's a brand that made for Americans' body figure not European body size. Old Navy everyday! Keep up the quality Gap. Thank you!",5
2022,"Very difficult to get pages to load, and if you do get it to load you can't get the ""filter"" menu to open",1
2022,"Garbage app. Never works. Not for signing in, not for searching, not for browsing. Super laggy, randomly crashes.",1
2022,"I had to change my rating, it rarely loads, when it does its because I've played with it for a while for it to finally show the shopping or home page. Please fix",2
2021,The app stinks. I enter my email and password and the message to enter a correct email and password combination keeps popping up over and over.,1
2023,Constantly crashes and always refreshes the page and brings you all the way up to the top. Super frustrating,1
2023,Is a good app when it works properly. It frequently kicks me out or won't let me sign back in. Often freezes and has to be shut down.,2
2023,App never works even after the update. It won't load the items and auto closes itself. Please fix the app!!!!!,1
2021,The app undated yesterday and it doesnt work correctly. It keeps bringing me to the update app page even after updating the app. Made an order and cant find it anywhwere??,3

2021,App does not open. You have to open from the play store. Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Still same issue.,1
2021,Every time I try to use the app it says Uh oh! Something went wrong... click refresh same thing. I try to look at different categories such as kids clothing or sales same thing this app doesn't work.,1
2022,"When I find something in stores that I love, I test the fit, go online, and get the right size and color. love the selection!",5
2021,"How can I rate it if I can't even log in. Says I have to go to the website to verify my account. I do that, log in, then go back to the app and it's not logged in. Try again and get the same message. Useless",1
2021,"This app sucks! Every time I try to log in to pay my bill there's always a problem. It asks for my ID, so I put it in and it tells me it's not my ID. Every freaking month it's the same thing. The app SUCKS!!!.",1

2022,"Unable to access card info, doesn't recognize the card, call to service is flawed. It cuts out right before asked what you need. The real person, had no idea what to do. T gave me a 56 character web site to use to log in. But, I am logged in. finally forwarded me to some one else. It took her less than 5 min to tell me the correct way to get card info. Shouldn't your reps know this? Shouldn't app guide thru the first registering? First impression is negative 10",1
2021,love old navy! it's been one of my favorite stores since I was a child. now i continue to shop at old navy for my kids as well. there new added sizes are awesome and cater to all shapes and sizes!,5

2022,"Its too slow, it takes forever to load. Its no my internet, Disappointing I'm a frequent shopper. They need to do something to fix it.",2
2021,This new app is awful! The selection and not being able to breakdown specific items. Who came up with this? Summer is coming up and I won't be ordering anything on this app!!,1

2023,Awful. App never works and has been the case for months. Glitches. Freezes. Can't even browse by department or searching.,1
2022,I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time I want to use it. The only reason I keep using it is because most of the stores in my area never have what I want. So many glitches.,2
2021,I hate hiw it brings you to the top everytime you're done looking at an item. You have to scroll all the way back down to find your place. Super annoying.,3
2022,Always easy to order off the app. Easy to return. I get most of clothes off the internet. I always get a quality product from Old Navy.,5
2021,"Constantly says ""something went wrong, please refresh"". I just updated the app and it still will not work. Guess I won't be shopping at Old Navy.",1
2021,It does not work! The new app does not update in moments. It does not update your orders. The old app was the best. This is a delay !!!!,1
2023,Shopping on the app became very frustrating due to a continued refreshing of the page I was on. As I scrolled the page it would jump me back to the beginning of the page and I would need to scroll back to where I was.,2
2023,The app has been so slow the last few months. I can't get any pages to download. Very disappointing. It was working great.,2
2021,Searching for my items and putting them in my cart was very easy But when it came time to check out a error message kept popping up and I'm still unable to check out,1
2022,"Logs me out all the time, even in the middle of checkout. So I don't get the points for my purchases, or it doesn't record them so I'm not able to track them.",2
2022,Love that I can shop on an app but will log you out randomly and will sometimes not even load correctly. Really just has bugs that need to be worked out.,2
2022,overall app is great. but search is not as great as it could be and pages randomly freeze.,4
2021,Terrible! Just terrible! Nothing loads. I can't add anything to the cart. I can't check past orders. I liked the old app better.,1
2022,"I can't look at anything. It says ""Something went wrong."" I am connected to WiFi and not having issues with any other apps or web searches.",1
2021,"This app keeps crashing, as soon as I sign in, it closes. Open it on the web and sign in just fine.",1
2022,"I was trying to make a purchase but I keep getting an error stating ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG "". I uninstalled the mobile app and reinstalled the mobile app but that didn't fix the issue. Ugh ?? ?? this sucks and frustrating.",1
2023,"This app is terrible. It is soooooooo slow. When I can finally choose a category, an error pops up. EVERY. DAMN. TIME.",1
2022,"App has been stuck on the Google play ""download it now"" screen for months. Working fine otherwise.",2
2022,Sometimes glitches and won't load properly but deals are awesome and easy to find what you're looking for.,4
2021,I don't want to but I will give this upgrade a one star because I did just download it but I can't figure out how to get to my old navy credit card account. It shouldn't be this difficult!,1
2021,Awesome products at good prices. Just wish they would have better customer service level in the stores..maybe the stores should hire people that even the manager a good gut feeling.,5
2022,I'm unable to remove items from cart and it won't let me sign in to my account. Edit: May 3rd 2022 I'm still unable to sign in through the app.,1
2022,One star at this point is too generous. It literally won't work on my phone. I open it up and its just blank and never opens.,1
2021,Slow! Can't get the updated app. Do not like it! I don't think Old Navy wants you to use your discounts and they created a very slow App.,1
2021,"The old app was better. I can't even look at anything, it just errors and kicks me out. Same thing happens with the gap app.",2
2023,"This app is terrible. Constantly closing for no reason, always losing my place and so many ""error can't find the page you're looking for"".",1
2022,App will not work I thought updating it would help but it did not. It would not let me check out I had to go to the website to check out. Worst app ever!,1
2022,Nothing works. Can't stay logged in. It used to work great. Not sure what they're going through but it's super buggy.,1
2022,"App keeps crashing, when trying add filters. Not really helpful, since shopping usually needs the filtering option",1

2023,Love this app easy and convenient it makes my life a lot easier when I'm looking for sales. Old Navy has a lot of good sales and affordable clothing wear with quality,4
2022,"App definitely doesn't work. So many glitches and most of the pages don't work. Nothing against actually Old Navy, the app just sucks.",1
2022,"Since the last update, not able to completely sign-in to the app. The screen overlaps not allowing me to enter my password",3
2022,I love all the deals & Promo can't beat the prices. I have 4 little ones I buy Birthday and Christmas gifts for. I make purchases year around.,5
2022,Old Navy app is not a good experience and ask your email address then it asked your email address with your password and then it'll go back and tell you to get online if you're using an app it's very non-user friendly.,1

2023,"Doesn't even work. Sits on loading screen forever, eventually just have to close it. It's not usable.",1
2021,I love that Old navy is supporting plus size womans clothing. It's important for plus size women to exercise. Getting healthy when you're ready is hard without clothing.,5
2021,"The only thing that works on this app is the shopping feature. I cant use the app to pay my card, check rewards or change profile information.",2
2021,I don't understand why I have to go to the Play store every time I want to open the app and now every time I try to open it it says something went wrong and there's just nothing there so I don't know why it keeps saying something went wrong for like weeks now fix it please,3

2023,App never loads any products. I can't ever log in so there is really no point in the app since I can't save any items or even keep things in my cart.,1
2021,Currently this application is completely busted. Clicking most any link inside the application will fail and cause you to close and restart the application.,1
2022,Great styles for men. But plus sizes are a hit and miss. the mostly just widen the size...not lengthen it. Nothing like a short square t shirt....,4

2021,I have gotten many clothes and deals from here for my child. I recommend Old Navy for your clothing. I love most of the selection.,5
2021,Not sure why you thought lumping all women into one category was inclusive. Bring back the separate section for plus size women. I promise my curves look way different in clothes than a size 2. Inclusivity means respecting our differences.,1
2022,"Recent update caused many things not to work, now can't see orders etc. ON has done this before with an update.....wish I hadn't updated. App worked great before update",1

2022,App makes me sign in multiple times before it works. Won't even load any pages. Can't shop it won't let me do anything.,1
2022,I like Old Navy once I figured out the sizing. T-shirts I size 1 up for a little dryer shrinking. OG button fly 1 size down and my regular size in zip up.,4
2022,"Keeps crashing, can't add anything to cart... actually, it won't even let me VIEW the cart ?? quite tragic. I just want some pants, man lol",3
2022,"Wow, this app is amazing ?? Great app experience so far. ON has great deals for men's clothes and fast free shipping. ON is my favorite new store!",5
2023,"Wish I could say negative stars. Worst app especially if you want to check on your credit card balance, transactions or pay.",1

2021,One of my top 5 favorite clothing store. The quality is excellent and the choice are a variety. I will forever be a customer of Old Navy and Gap,5
2022,"Used to work great. Now every time i click on something, it signs me out. So frustrating and time consuming.",1
2021,App is not working. Hate when you guys try update things and it does not work. I see others have complained for a couple of days and it is still not fixed. You are going to loose customers.,1
2021,Something went wrong. I get that message when I select a category to shop. This new app has never worked. Please fix it.,2

2022,the app can be finicky when adding favorites -- it doesn't always save the exact color and size selections you make,4
2021,I like to shop at Old Navy they have everything for the whole family and there staff are very helpful. I like to shop online too because it's so easy,5
2022,My security app continues to find the Old Navy app as an issue. This is the only one it does not approve so I will not have it on my phone.,1
2021,As a plus size woman I can never find comfort and confident clothes and as well as being pregnant and matching my daughter. old navy has literally checked off every box and I could not be happier and confident wearing there clothes. thank you OLD NAVY your my hero,5
2023,Experience displays good quality and customer service that displays complete understanding.,5
2021,the app works amazing and is very easy to use. Old Navy has always been my go to for jeans which last forever! Prices are get for budgeting!????????????,5
2022,This app is torture. Stop enticing me with great deals that I cannot have because of your app. It's borderline false advertising.,1

2021,Every time I open the app it directs me to install the new updated app....I have the most recent version already! Then it completely logs me out.,3
2022,app has improved significantly. easy to view the items and visualize how it may fit especially with the extra sizing models,5
2021,I have ordered many times from old navy! I have never had any problems. the shipments have always arrived on time.,5
2021,"So good, especially since I can't just go to the store...lol! Great service and delivery time. Thanks Old Gap Banana Repub. I shop them all",5
2022,"App takes forever to load. More times than not, nothing loads at all and I give up trying to shop here and go to my Amazon app instead.",2

2022,This app is horrible. No matter where I click it logs me out. The fact that it doesn't work frustrates me and makes me not want to be bothered,1
2023,"I routinely have issues with things either not loading at all, or taking forever to load. This app needs work.",2
2022,Horrible app! Have to open via Google Play Store every time. Seems like it has to be updated weekly. Unable to checkout. Worthless,1
2021,When I try to open any page on the app it tells me to refresh because it can't open the page. What's the point of this when you can't see any clothes??,1
2022,I love Old Navy. They always have some kind of sale going on. Their customer service is terrific. They find yh3 answers if they don't know it. I would recommend Old Navy to everyone!!,5
2022,The app hasn't worked for a week now. it won't let me sign in and when I'm finally able to it has my cart messed up.,1

2021,Everything was fine with the app I'm not sure why they changed it because now whenever I try to log in it keeps giving me the notification to update the app and then when I clicked to update it it just opens the app I updated it already so I don't know why it keeps showing like I haven't updated the app,5
2021,Horrible. Installed new app and can't even log in. Keep getting error messages and redirects to web browser.,1
2021,error message/bugs. When you try to move from home screen there is always an error message. Hunk of junk app,1

2021,"This app crashes, doesn't populate and never works.I encounter the same issues with the BR and the Gap apps... too difficult to bother with!",1
2022,App doesn't work. Continously loading. I have to use the actual website if I ever want to search for or purchase an item.,1
