Year,Review
2021,"This new app does flow a lot better than the last one, the shopping process and navigation seems more fluid. However still a couple cons to mention - there is no longer the option to shop on Gap Factory. Also when you're browsing and press the back button, instead of taking you back where you left off, it scrolls back up top of the page, so you have to scroll all the way down again. Also there's no option to ""sort by"" with the filter feature."
2021,"Checkout is confusing, I installed the app thinking it was going to be less hassle than the web page, but everytime I tried to checkout it showed me that I was going to get charged for shipping when I get free shipping with my card, if I wasn't paying attention I would have placed the order and would have gotten charged for shipping. It also listed a different address (a relatives) as primary I had to delete it so I could continue. I would say it does have easy access to rewards and coupons"
2021,"App is a serious downgrade from the last version (which didn't seem possible). That I have to re-download it every time I open it is a frustrating reminder. If it were were to fix the bugs-added feature of the update, that'd be great, but, nope: just as it can no longer remember where on a page you were browsing if you click on an item and then go back, it also can't remember that you've upgraded the app ten times already. At this point, I just want to pay my bill and be done with this company."
2021,"After looking at item details and you try to go back to the previous screen, it starts at the top again. It's so annoying! I scrolled through pages and pages...looked at an item, and then had to basically start again, it doesn't keep your spot. I am excited about the ability to ? items because I have always wanted a favorites list for Old Navy and this has it! Thanks for that feature....but please fix the scrolling problem."
2022,"The browsing experience is good, not great. The app sometimes lags. Checkout experience could use some work. I keep getting an error message when trying to check out, even after clearing my cache and data. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and am experiencing the same issue. The promo code for using the app would be great if we could actually check out!"
2021,"I was excited to see that there was anew app available since the last one was exceedingly slow... In this new one the shopping interface looks good but the actual payment & billing portal hasn't changed at all and still has the same issues. Slow and I kept getting an error when trying to look at my account summary, statements, etc. Not really a new app. Try again."
2021,"The new app has updated my shipping address to the wrong location twice now. Upon checkout the correct info displays but now two orders have shipped to the wrong state and it's really hard to get help from their customer service team. The new app won't load my order history. When you go back, it does not save where you were so you have to scroll to get back. Cannot find gap factory. The old version was much better. New version is awful."
2023,"3/2023 Update! Another app update. And yet, you're still redirected to the very beginning of your feed when you hit the back button. If you've scrolled through dozens or hundreds of items, you'll have to scroll past to locate your previous place and hopefully you remember where that is. I wont be ordering anything from this app. Waaaaaayyyy to frustrating."
2021,"It's meh. The website, mobile or otherwise, is still more user friendly and better. You can't 'sort by' on the app, for example. And when you add something to your cart and go backwards to continue looking, it brings you to the top of the page instead of where you were. The mobile website has these features."
2023,What's the point of this app? I downloaded thinking all be able to scan the items in store to help see it online and it won't scan. Says it's none of the barcodes are recognizable. Really bad app.
2023,"I love Gap! It's easy to shop online. I don't have time to shop. Excellent quality clothes, great sales, and my granddaughters always adore their clothes! Thanks, Gap, for making life a little easier."
2023,"I am repeatedly asked to update the ap ""for a better app experience"". I have tried updating it several times now and I cannot even access my account. How is this a better experience? This is very frustrating. I will soon be deleting this app if this continues. I cannot access shopping, either."
2023,"Still cannot pay for Gap card balance. Every attempt to pay for card balance on the app gives an error message as soon as you click on the ""pay"" button. Been like that for over a month, the update didn't fix that."
2023,It's as if the Gap team doesn't optimize the app experience at all. You'd probably make more sales if you did. On an S23 with full bars I can't get anything to load without ridiculous load times. For as much as the mobile browser pushes the app you'd think the app would be better than it is
2023,"Unhappy. I had to uninstall and reinstall just to get the uodate to stick. Now the filters do not stay set. I filter for mens then search shorts and I see both men and women's items. I filter shorts then narrow down to mens and see all sale items. If youre going to give incentives to use the app, please make the app worthwhile."
2023,"I can't save to favorites, it won't ever load correctly. It's updated I thought maybe that was the problem but it continues to happen. I can't ever search through the app for kids clothing"
2023,"Love Gap clothes for granddaughter. Great quality with good fit. Clothes look still new after many washes. With sales often get clothes for similar prices of Target, Old Navy etc. but much better quality. Typically get several seasons out of clothes which saves as well."
2023,"The app responsiveness is very bad. I downloaded app to get additional 20% discount if we shop from app. But adding the promo code, the updated shopping cart did not load and did not let me checkout. Defeats the purpose of the promotion. Very bad app design."
2023,Gap sometimes has the absolute best sales!!! I luv it! it's worth ones time :)
2023,Great love easy to navigate easy to purchase!
2023,"Not sure why Gap Inc still has a different app for each brand but none of them work properly, especially the wallet area. You would think they would make credit card payments as easy as possible."
2023,"Keeps crashing even after update, I can't add anything to my bag I just get the circle of death and then the app closes. Kind of funny I was going to make a purchase today but you lost my money!"
2023,Not great. This app seems to error out more than any other app I have ever used. It's also extremely slow when it loads.
2023,"As a man, I love Gap's simplicity and it's not overwhelming shopping there"
2023,"The app for almost a year actually won't keep your favorites. When you are logged in and press the heart to favorite items and then go back to review your favorites altogether, nothing will be saved. Also while scrolling and you click on items to view them larger and go back to the page with all the items it will bring you back to the top to everything you already viewed, causing you to have to scroll beyond them again; sometimes it will refresh the items in a different randomized order."
2023,"I've got the gap credit card, and making payments on the app is not smooth, in my opinion. Always has errors. And when you do make a monthly payment, it doesn't update the payment due date, which makes you wonder if the payment went through."
2023,my go-to for clothes they just fit me well and accentuate my style.
2023,"Their app sucks. It's worse than their website. Even worse is we ordered something, and they acted like it was being shipped by UPS, giving us a tracking number. After several days, GAP website shows that UPS still has it, yet UPS website shows it was forwarded to USPS. Now with a USPS tracking number, the USPS website shows pending. After a ""FULL SEVEN DAYS"" I requested a status through USPS Customer Service to be informed that they never received it. GAP Cust Service says to keep waiting.?."
2023,"This app has not worked for me for the past three months. I have updated, deleted, and reinstalled numerous times."
2023,I can't even get anything to load when I click any link from the home page. Haven't been able to in months. Terrible.
2023,Gap is great. their app not sure much
2023,always creative selections
2023,Keeps crashing when I go to login
2023,so many styles of jeans to choose from now!! thank you
2022,"This app asks to sign in several times after I click on any item to add to cart and even after signing in it still says ""refresh - something went wrong"" and never works to add anything at all to cart. I've tried it for several days and same thing is happening on both my tablet and phone. Will shop somewhere else because it's happening with BR, old Navy, gap and Athleta."
2023,app runs a little slow. I wish you could tap add discounts like online instead of copy/paste discount codes
2021,Paying my Gap card is such a challenge. The app doesn't work to do this and when I login to the mobile site - I get an error message. I have to hit refresh or try different parts of the day to get it to work. It's beyond frustrating. I was just upgraded to a Visa signature card and considering cancelling because it is not user friendly to pay bill online.
2022,"Its rare for a company to create an app that makes it more difficult to purchase. I went from buying 3x/mo to buying every 3 mos 100% due to the new app & UI. Constantly have to log in, (rewards log in doesn't get past login so no access to wallet) can't access rewards or see deal details, and can't access gap factory. This is ridiculous."
2021,"I love GAP....always have. Going on 20+ years now. The quality is mostly there and everything washes easily and looks good for years (when passing on clothes to younger siblings). It's just easy, good quality, keeps up with the styles and feels good. Also, ordering online or doing any returns has been easy too. Always feel taken care of.?? I'm to spend my money at the GAP. Worth it."
2022,"Excellent fit, extraordinary style, extremely trendy styles, amazing prices, fabulous selection and variety of different styles and fashion choices for all genders to choose from and all at great locations. If you're anywhere close to the Wichita area there is a very nice sized GAP Store located right there on the East Side in the Mall. And it's really easy to find!!! You can place your order online and then then select the nearest location to you to have it delivered to and then go pick it up!"
2022,Not sure if I ever feel comfortable shopping here again. I bought a pair of shoes for my daughter to wear and when she tried it on her foot got hurt due to a magnetic metal security tag end being left on there. When I called to complain the best they could do was offer a $25 coupon for future shopping. Not sure if I feel safe shopping here anymore.
2021,"Works very well for me! First time, ran like a champ. ... not just a sr. UI dev, but as a brand new user, TOO! Also runs on my Android 8 device, which is now I use as a tablet. Good navigation, easy to read screens, and understand. the workflow very easily. Have 5 items in my bag.... :-) Good job!"
2022,"Logs me out immediately... Most annoying thing ever. I just want to browse and buy things, but it's impossible!! I would use the regular website, but the shopping experience there is more complicated. Please fix"
2022,"Won't even let me check out. I kept getting error messages when I click on check out. My free shipping benefit as an icon member is also not being recognized. I don't have to spend $50 to get free shipping on the website. Lastly, it only gives me Gap order info and none on my Banana orders. It's better to just keep using the website. The app is useless."
2023,If your using their filter system if you go back from looking at an item it restarts all over again especially for the banana republic link. Also on it's banana republic link it doesn't let you zoom in so you don't have a clear image of the type of material the fabric is.
2022,"I do not recommend you download this app. It's always lagging, always some type of error during checkout or when you are trying to make a payment. It always redirects to the website anyway so there is no point having this installed. Save time and storage and just use the website."
2023,App Not worth the hassle. It takes you back to the beginning over and over. Very frustrating
2022,"App doesn't work. When I try to shop and open a specific section, it just tells me something went wrong and to try to refresh which then just gives me the same message. It's been this way for a couple weeks now. I guess I will delete the app."
2021,When I try to go to payment it's always saying something is wrong and to refresh and when I hit refresh it's still saying something is wrong. I never had this problem with the older app. All of the other functions and features are doing this as well.
2022,"Not consistent with my information from my emails. Such as reward points, Gap cash amounts, orders past and present and more. Hard to find a phone number for customer service. Makes online shopping a little difficult."
2022,"It never keeps me logged in. Half the reason I downloaded it was so I could stay logged in and wouldn't have to remember my password. I really enjoyed it for the sale reminders and saving coupons, but I feel such a huge flash of annoyance when I have to go through the password schpiel again that I'm going to delete it."
2022,"Gap has offered consistent quality and fun fashion for both children and adults. Sometimes their fashion is too heavy on fad for my liking but when they make their way back around to classic design, I can be sure to find clothes for the whole family."
2021,"Interface is kind of better than the old app but making payments on the credit card is trash. Payment date pulls up a calendar to click the date but then it doesn't go through because ""date has to be in mmddyyyy format"" but you can't just type in the date??"
2023,great prices. great app
2023,"I love gap, however the app does get stuck sometimes, I'd recommend getting that bug fixed!"
2021,"Keeps crashing when trying to open it. It did work fine a few days ago, but not addressing this issue for 24+ hours is not a good reflection on the company. Otherwise, the app is a solid 4."
2021,This app would be a 5 star app if only when you click on a item to view and then go back it doesn't take you to where you left off but all the way back to the top. So frustrating and I just get tired of scrolling all the way down to where I left off so I don't end up buying anything!
2022,"Really kind of a bummer to offer an extra discount for using the app to turn around and not be able to checkout in the app. Just keep getting ""something went wrong. Hit refresh"""
2021,"could be improved. after selecting an item if you go back, it takes you to the top of the product list and you have to scroll down again. very frustrating. i could not find an option for sorting."
2023,"Can no longer check out on the app. I always get an error. The lag on the app makes it almost impossible to use, constantly freezing and shutting down."
2021,"I have updated this app. But the app still says to update and sends me to the play store. It says on 9/9 they fixed bugs. It still won't let me go into the sight, it tells me to upgrade which I did a long time ago."
2023,somehow so much worse than just browsing the website
2021,The app as well as all affiliates are not working. Clicking on departments is problematic; a refresh message will appear and won't work. The app is useless.
2023,app kinda sucks. doesn't always load. will stop and close for no reason. not the best
2022,definitely works better than just logging onto the gap's web page. everything moved along very smoothly without any crashing or stalling. i will be using the app from now on. nice job!
2021,"App sucks. Old one was better. Also, in the ""Tell us more"" question, ""Does this app have a positive impact on your life?"" Really? Lol. No app can be ""On"" my life. But does it have a positive impact ""In"" my life. No it doesn't. It's a negative impact. Guessing the people who wrote the question, probably also designed the app."
2023,"Imagine that, another failed update. It asks me to update every time I go into the app, but never updates anything"
2023,"I always find great styles that look great on me despite my short stature, 4'7"""
2023,Never works. Constantly freezes or gives an error message.
2023,feel like it's slow to load but I'm really enjoying shopping on all their sister brands
2023,Super slow application. Needs updating every week! Really bad
2023,A good app with four different stores syncs in one. User friendly
2023,didn't let me pay with Paypal even though I didn't use any gift cards. sort of glitchy
2023,takes forever to load. glitches and shuts down.
2023,"for me the app is slow, sometimes never loads and crashes"
2021,"Can't seem to sort by price or ""on sale"" and not. Other than that, great app. And even after all of these years, there's nowhere I'd rather shop than the Gap. Love that they have Medium-Tall and 34-in inseams in everything!"
2022,"This app hardly ever works. Which is very disappointing. I've been shopping with gap for a long time, and I shop often. I finally decided to get the app and it has done nothing but cause frustration. I hope it gets better."
2022,"This update stinks. I can't log on like I don't know my user name and password. But the annoyance didn't start there. It started when I went into the app to pay my bill. Maybe I'm crazy but I don't see anywhere to access my credit card. Then when I go to the site, it doesn't know who I am. FAIL. Update: So I can find the card but can't log in cuz my password is always wrong. How? I know my password"
2021,"This app fails at the most basic thing: logging into my account. And it fails in a revealing and concerning way! The crash makes me seriously question whether any part of the app is secure. Technical details follow: the app crashes with an error indicating JSON parse failure. For some reason, the password is concatenated plain-text into a would-be JSON string. Note that my password contains a backslash \ that isn't followed by any valid JSON escape character. (When I type my password and add another \ so that the JSON string will escape properly, login is successful. That is not a good user experience.) In other words: prior to concatenation, the password is not hashed (preferred) and also not properly escaped (which is necessary when not hashed). So the JSON parser crashes the entire app because the password value is not a correct string. What would happen if I typed a closing "" and provided my own custom JSON as part of the password entry? Anyway, the fact that a password is included plain-text into a JSON string introduces serious concerns that this app is not properly securing my account credentials. And with that being the case, what else is it not securing?"
2023,The app won't even load. Just as good as the actual website.
2023,The app won't even open! It is frustrating!!
2023,"Good app, but freezes 75% of the time"
2021,"The Gap is one of my go to stores and I primarily shop online, but the app has always been a problem. Now with the most recent update, it does not work at all. Very disappointing. I'm uninstalling the app now."
2023,It crashes or pages won't load frequently
2022,"Very frustrating to place an order. The app kept signing me out and when I finally got to checkout, I was charged shipping when I shouldn't have. Highly doubt I'll order anything else from the app at this point."
2022,"Worked perfectly for me until it forced me to update. Now it's completely unusable, as it crashes literally seconds after I try to open it, every single time."
2021,"Keeps reminding me to upgrade, already did. Keep getting ""Something is wrong"" error. My rewards don't show up, I have to manually type them."
2021,"Keeps crashing. Every time I open the app, it closes and errors out. Please fix. When it works, the app is great."
2023,I always get the assistance from the workers and I love the quality and the discount .
2023,bought school clothes for the grandbabies
2023,love the brand and prices
2021,"Since the upgrade (downgrade), this new version takes me to the play store every time I try to open the app and its not as easy to navigate."
2021,"It is very difficult, because always whenever I am trying to log in. I need to change everything again and again!!! I know it has to be precarious but no difficult. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT"
2021,"The app opens but unable to view any items. It just goes to a page that says ""Something Went Wrong."" Its been like this for at east a few weeks, no update available in PlayStore."
2021,"Once the app opens, it's fine. BUT I shouldn't have to go through Google Play every time I want to open it! (Yes, I have the latest version of the app, thank you Gap for asking...every time ??)"
2021,"The new Gap & Old Navy apps are ridiculous!! I linked my card, searched for my rewards before checking out that I knew I had only to see a big 0. The cashier can see them but I cannot?! Really?? I signed in again a few days later. Still no rewards."
2022,I'm on a pixel 6 and the app won't let me check out. It just keeps telling me something went wrong when I hit the checkout button. Very frustrating!
2022,"Always loved shopping at Gap, but so nice that the app allows you to show all brands with a single check out. can use multiple promo codes and store rewards points as well."
2022,It was a 5 star until I saw a charge of $300.00 on Gap and then to my surprise there was also a 300.00 charge on my card to Old Navy. I till this day haven't gotten my credit (refund) to my card. How many stars would you give them.
2022,"the app in nice but it keeps glitching. can't log into my account, most options take a lifetime to load and sometimes they don't after which it kicks you out"
2021,"""Something went wrong."" Why are you so bad at this?? Even when I access your site using a browser, the reviews won't show up. I haven't bought anything from you for quite a while because your technology absolutely sucks!"
2023,Don't like the new update. Still tells me to update and I have. Page refreshes to the beginning while I'm still browsing. Very frustrating. Please fix! You're my favorite store.
2022,"I find it very difficult to use your website, in particular trying to sign in to my account. Your screen would not let me enter my password and I had to try 5 times to do so. please fix this problem!"
2022,Good app. I love that I can flip between the brands. The app is a little slow to load which can be very frustrating
2021,"The old Gap website was soooo much better. I already downloaded the app but everytime I try to open it, it tell me to download it again. Not as easy to shop on either."
2022,Whenever I search for any women's clothing items. It always includes MATERNITY items. I can't be the ONLY one that has this problem. Please include a FILTER to weed maternity clothes out of the searchs.
2021,"Unsuccessful. Error message EVERY TIME I sign in. Have deleted and reinstalled app 3x, cleared cache, & history. Stick with the web."
2022,"Lately- does not load deal information at top, only sometimes loads shopping pages. It seems to be getting slowly less functional."
2022,"Gap has a great selection of basics, essentials, and inclusive sizes. The discounts and sales are also a huge plus."
2022,By far one of the worst apps I've used. Crashed frequently when trying to complete a purchase. Will stick to website for future purchases.
2023,Never loads. It's hard to take advantage of the discounts when you can't see any of the merchandise.... Blank screen loading for more than 5 minutes
2023,I can't shop when the pages are always loading and never load. I can't see any items. That's why I shop on the regular site and not the app.
2022,Gaps' upgrades always disrupts the ability to sign in to my account. Gaps' makes it very difficult to use your website. I am displeased with the outcome of Gaps attempts to better upgrade your website.
2022,Rip off company my wife placed three separate orders and each order was sent to a different address. Gap refused to refund or send replacement. Each time they said it had to be purchased again.
2022,Latest update has bug. Cannot delete items in cart or apply codes. Changes trigger repeated log on screen even when logged on.
2021,Ok so the visual is great and the accessibility works well however the fact that PayPal is not recognizing my address when directed from the app and afterpay is not an option ?? you have some upgrading to do but I appreciate the effort
2021,Love the GAP's high quality and beautiful clothing! Absolutely worth every penny. The GAP stores are wonderful! Both online and in person.... the customer service is wonderful.
2023,"Used to work great. Now it's hard to shop. Can't sort clothes by size. Take a look at one piece or add to the bag you have to start scrolling from where you started, who has time for that???"
2022,"Cannot use the check out. It won't work. Tried getting help via phone with customer service, but code is only valid through the app."
2021,"My app is up to date, but when I try to start looking for clothing I get ""An error has occurred"" It's been this way for a few weeks, if I can't use the app I may just cancel my card."
2022,"They cancel your card if you open other credit card accounts and use credit elsewhere, not for missing payments just because they want to."
2022,"the app doesn't work very well. sometimes things take forever to load. sometimes they don't load at all. at the very least, it's still functional."
2021,It's always a challenge when it comes to paying your bill. Honestly I can't stand trying to long in and paying my bill. This is the main reason why I don't use my GAP card!
2021,after this upgrade now it keeps taking me to the play store to update and reinstall the same update over and over every time i open the app its very annoying. Its worse tban before.
2021,Cannot look at anything on the app. It constantly empties my cart and signs me out. So frustrating and I can't use my rewards.
2023,It just doesn't work. What's the point of installing an app that takes literally forever to load and doesn't show you any products?
2023,I love shopping @ gap
2022,"Small lags in loading while shopping. But worse, when I hit checkout it wouldn't stop loading, and ultimately lost everything in my cart :("
2021,Everytime I want to shop it keeps telling something went wrong or to refresh the page. This is really starting to frustrate me
2021,"Can't even use after logging in. Closes out on me everytime- doesn't matter if I use Gap, Old Navy, BR, Athleta. All the same. Website is WAY better than this juvenile waste of an app"
2021,"Wont permit me in making a credit card payment, so frustrating! For the past weeks it gives me a go back & try again message."
2022,Updated the app 7/20/22. When app opens...little flower just spins. Never shows an item to purchase. What a money saver!
2023,This app is very buggy and I can't even sign in to my own account. You are better off using a browser instead of this app.
2022,I can't use the app only coupon because the app won't let me check out. I keep getting an error when I try.
2021,"Grrrrr there is a persistent error: ""something went wrong"". Cant see any items. What is the point of the app if I can't shop?!!"
2023,great choices of all cotton
2022,Constantly logs me out. What is the point off an app if I have to keep logging in? I might as well just open a webpage.
2023,My wallet and recent transactions are almost always not working correctly! Its very frustrating!
2022,"I love Gap. I love shopping at Gap However, this app is extremely frustrating. It does not allow me to check out."
2021,I do not like that after seeing one item it takes me back to the top of the page and have to find where I left off. And now I can't find the other apps like old navy.
2021,"The Gap app is convenient way to find Gap, BR, & Old Navy sale/clearance items all in one place and see new items worth trying on in the store."
2022,"The most annoying app ever. I love the brand but their app it's the worst. You have to put the password like 200,000 times."
2021,"Everytime I want to open the app, it takes me to Google play to update. This issue should be fixed asap."
2022,"I love Gap tshirts. Seems like the fit and material has gotten cheaper. Please go back to the vintage v-neck t,s!!"
2021,"Lot of issues with this new app version, one of them is once you click on payment methods i can see its coming ""Something went wrong"" always"
2022,The old one is better before fu*<$ng barclay take over there is something wrong with the apps and because of that i missed my payment and they charge me late fee ?????? thats how they rob you
2023,"Unusable app. Constantly loading and gets hung up. I try to use the app, then switch to the website"
2023,I *only* wear GAP! ?? always have ~ always will!
2022,"Stylish, good quality clothing for the whole family! Gap never disappoints, the atmosphere is family friendly!"
2021,I never had a problem until I updated to the new app. This new app is not working at all! I can't get into any dept. Please fix!
2021,"Almost every thing I wear is Gap or Old navy. Great quality, current styles, and you can't beat their prices!"
2023,"when you view items then try to return to list/grid, system resets randomly and you have to scroll all over again to find your viewed item again."
2023,Great quality clothing
2023,Best clothes around!
2022,"I have been a GAP customer since the early 80's! At 61 yrs young I still find great age appropriate clothes at Gap! Also, GAP has some great sales??"
2023,Yup this app is pretty much junk. Nothing ever loads aside from the homepage. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing.
2022,"love the clothes and online ordering and easy/free returns. the app lags a bit, though."
2023,This is my store prices are cheap clothes are gorgeous
2023,It's pretty good. Would've been 5 stars if they allowed us to sign in with Google.
2023,Super buggy still...
2023,I like how u can access all the other brands in one app
2023,The app is not very user friendly
2023,Tired of this app. Hardly ever works and when it does it makes you re-sign in to your account every time you go to a new page.
2021,Crashes immediately after I try to enter the promotional code. Totally useless. Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
2023,I love the Gap but the app is intermittent sometimes. also must be signed into your acct to shop. that's weird..

2009,The worst company to ever work for they treat their employees like crap and majority of their managers are racist as fuck dontworkthere
2009,Your company give people anxiety cause they treat employees like crap Your store at downtown crossing in Boston is the worst your manager Zack treat my coworkers like crapEveryones end up quitting due to the way he treat us  the store is a mess nasty full of dirt
2009,Ill never biy from you again You robbed me  Give me mu order or my money back Pick yp the phone or replan email

2021,"Ordered the Yeezy Gap jacket around July, they provided updates that it would be shipped before December 25th. Just got a random email saying my order was cancelled. The customer service representative said it was cancelled because it's expected to be shipped on January, this is ridiculous. I could have used that money to short the stock."

2021,"I like these brands so I use them and I want them all the time. I have no experience, I am new, I want to be by your side always. I can move forward if you help me. And I will try to help you enough. Thanks for helping me."
2020,"Is Gap even in business? Ive asked myself this question numerous times over the past 7 weeks as I wait for Gap to refund my money on the order I returned. My emails go unanswered and after several calls where I was placed on hold for over an hour each time, Im ready to concede Ill never see my money again. I will never buy from this company again. Covid or not, this is by far the worst customer service Ive ever experienced. Shame on you Gap!"
2020,"I placed my orders with Gap on Dec 7th. They didn't even process the order until the 13th I was told and my Christmas gifts for my children will not arrive until Dec. 28, if they are not delayed again. I will return everything once it arrives, since I have to go out and shop again. I will never order from them again and hope that they are one of the stores that does not survive the pandemic."

2019,"Bought man short for $18 2 weeks ago and was thinking I will have a better deal on Black Friday so let's hold on. Here is Black Friday and I am shopping again in Schaumburg Gap and I see the same shorts 3 times more expensive with ""Black Friday"" discount %40. And the final price is around $25. What a BS Black Friday for FOOLS!"
2019,The variety is small but the quality makes up for it in the end. The clothing cost is reasonable. I really like the overall style for casual wear that has some accented urban wear tones within some of their high-end pieces. I appreciate the choice of accessories available allowing me to complete an outfit without having to journey to another store which allows the buyer to stay coordinated within one brand from head to toe.
2019,"I was so excited to find some great options for this coming summer at reduced prices. I had an extensive order of several things. However, a few days after I placed my order, I got an email that my entire order had been cancelled. No issue with payment, no notification other than the cancellation had already taken place. They did mention an option to reorder my things by calling Customer Service. I shop almost 100% online and have never had such a negative experience. Stay away - read all the negative experiences people have had. It's not worth your rise in blood pressure! Plenty of other fabulous companies that understand and provide customer service."
2018,"On 12/3/18 I ordered 5 clothing items to be delivered for Christmas as a gift for my Godson who lives in another state. On 12/14/18 his mother informed me 3 items were received. I checked online to see the status of the other two items and saw an expected delivery date of 12/21/18. On 12/21/18 I called customer service because the items weren't there. I was told that these items were ""out of stock"" and they would reverse the charges for me."
2018,"The first store told us that we had to go to the kid's outlet for the return. I left the receipt at home. I showed them the emails with the stated price. I even called their customer service on my cell phone. They wouldnt refund the money. Last year, I had multiple problems with a holiday order and decided to donate them to a childrens charity because it wasnt worth the shipping or gas costs. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY OR THE STORES."

2018,"Gap cancelled my order twice and never followed up to make it right. I called and talked to a service representative to have the item reordered after it was cancelled and was told the item was in stock. Five days later the order was cancelled again, and nothing was done about it. They have since not responded to any of my emails. I'm pretty upset because I was looking forward to getting the item and the experience ended up being very frustrating and disappointing. I will not be buying from this company again."

2016,"Had my son not requested this specific item for Christmas, I would not have ordered a 2nd time. Faced issues with shipping and customer service."
2015,I paid off my card and then get a letter saying I was due a refund and how do I want it. I asked for a check. They mail the check and a month later send me another letter saying they made a mistake and charged my card. Wondering if it's happened to others so they get you trapped and start charging interest and fees again. I worked hard to pay that off.
2015,"At one point, I did call to place an order. The rep was pleasant, helpful and did offer some additional savings for my trouble, but I don't want to call every time I need to place an order. I shop online, so I don't have to deal with people. To that end, I am beyond frustrated and have begun shopping elsewhere. My loyalty lies with a company that can consistently offer me the experience I desire."

2011,"I still shop at Gap occasionally, but I'm much more selective about what I buy. I only buy items that are on sale and I always check the reviews before I buy anything. I'm also not as happy with the selection as I used to be. I think Gap needs to update its style."
