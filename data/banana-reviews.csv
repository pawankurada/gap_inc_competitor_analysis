2023,"2023 Update: Stability issues remain. Always slow to load, even on high quality wifi. 2021: I frequently ship the Gap website. This app very frequently says ""oops something went wrong"" when the website is working.",2

2023,"Size filters do not work properly, makes for an awful shopping experience.",1
2023,Hot girls shop here,5
2023,"There's an issue of slow loading, and I had trouble using the checkbox ""use the same address for shipping"", as checking it deletes everything and made me enter both manually. Other than that, i think the app is perfect and the display of items is simply decent.",4
2023,Not easy. I'd like 2 browse first an it will not let me oh well money kept.!!,1

2023,"Application is easy to use. All new products highlighted, which means I can easily shop for them as they were released. Also the variety of products makes it easy to shop for different styles.",5
2023,"Love banana republic, but the app rarely works. Even with solid internet via wifi, pages refuse to load the majority of the time or take an exceptionally long time. Clicking on notifications typically results in the app opening with nothing depicted.",3
2023,The app has been horrible since day one. It's better to use your web browser,2

2023,great app and like what clothes and accessories they sell,5

2023,Connection problems every day,1
2023,It's usually not up-to-date. It's slow to load. I keep having to Uninstaller then reinstall to get an update.,1
2023,Constantly signs me out. This makes it difficult to keep using the app.,1
2023,"This apps needs a major overhaul. It's always has some ""unexpected error"". Get it together, Banana Republic. This is disappointing.",1
2023,I can't stand retail apps that can't save my information when they update! You have definitely lost sales because of this. Fire your app team and get a different one.,2
2023,The classic tailored look of Banana Republic is a welcome to the messy boho look.,5
2023,Never works.,1
2023,"Wanted to love the convenience of shopping all their brands in one app, but rarely works.",1
2023,Nearly all of the shopping categories result in an error with no way to browse product,1
2023,The worst app ever will not let view a single item without a bug was gonna make big purchase. Just uninstall big brands like this to have terrible shopping apps.,1
2023,"Great store, atrocious app. Never loads, blank screens, purchases don't process. It's like they don't want me to spend my money.",1
2023,great app and great service in store,4
2023,Freezes - can't actually make any order. Also keeps selecting shipping address that's not the default.,1
2023,"I love the quality, customer service, and sales!",5
2023,The app loads like you're using 3G data.,1
2023,"The absolute worst retail/shopping app I've encountered. It doesn't load. Right now, it keeps saying I need to update it although its the latest version. In the years I've had it, it hasn't worked way more often than it has. Ridiculously pointless. Dont download. Save the memory on your phone!",1
2023,Good ap to have.,5
2023,App takes so long to open. So I will have to remove app from my phone unfortunately.,1
2023,loyal,5
2023,Doesn't anyone test the update prior to lunching it? You just pushed an update an hour ago and now the app doesn't work.,1
2023,"The past couple updates have made the app basically unusable. I spend more time staring at a flashing ""BR"" than shopping.",3
2023,app is a pain.,3
2023,"My Girls Love BR Swimsuits. They are 5yrs, 8yrs, 12 & 15yrs old. OK. Me too...Not Givin My Age.??",5
2023,app crashes,3
2023,App crashes frequently. Try to set store - app crashes Try to set multiple filters - app crashes,1
2023,"The app takes a long time to load, if it loads at all. Haven't been able to shop on my phone for months. It also requires me to sign in everytime. Please fix this app!",1
2023,Doesn't work,1
2023,Worst Shop ever. DON'T BUY HERE. they won't even exchange to a smaller size of same item if you bought it on sale. Same with GAP and others in the same company. NEVER BUY SALE ONLINE IN THESE STORES.,1
2023,THE TRUTH WILL SET ANY INDIVIDUL FREE AND THE GAP CAN BE FOR THE REAL FRIENDS GET THIS APP IT GOT ME,5
2023,"The app has terrible functionality for basic things. It will close randomly, make me sign in at least once a week, and pages take forever to load sometimes. I've had to either go back to the previous page and then re-tap the page I want to load before anything will come up, or close the app entirely and relaunch to get pages to load. Crazy that basic navigation is so buggy. Not to mention certain filters won't even work sometimes forcing you to scroll through many items.",2
2023,occasionally app crashes,4
2023,crashes every once in a while and kinda clunky.,4
2023,Quality affordable and stylish clothing.,5
2023,Too many bugs for an app to use in 2023! We expect a better search field. Page starts from beginning when you go back from one item.,2
2023,"still buggy. you can be applying for credit card, looking at offers, checking out and app will close. but you get extra 15% off for ordering through app",2
2023,This app loads so slow,1
2023,This app version is absolutely terrible and never functions correctly.,1
2023,Does not keep filtered search. After I curate a filtered list of clothing I want to search from I click a shirt or pant to view. When I go pack to the main list the filtered criteria is gone and I have to select size and type of clothing I am searching for all over again. Very frustrating. Often has an error when first opening. Needs to be restarted frequently.,2
2023,App is pretty bad. Doesn't load and if it does usually takes 10 minutes per click. I've seen other users have the same problem since 21 but the issues were never fixed. Honestly not really sure why you would make an app and never fix the issues.,1
2023,Weak Slow,1
2023,best fit,5
2023,Is this app still updating??,2
2023,Very slow and sometimes doesn't even load properly.,1
2023,"Wonky, doesn't work 50% of the time, navigation is from the stone age.",2
2023,Freezes up often. Won't get past the BR loading screen. I unistalled.,1
2023,"It keeps malfuctioning. Everytime I hit the ""shop"" icon and then the ""men"" section it says ""something went wrong"", no matter how many times I try to refresh it or close the app and reopening it, now it's telling me to ""update"" when all updates are currently installed....",1
2023,App freezes open opening. Can't click on anything s22 ultra,1
2023,Love the quality!,5
2023,"Love the quality, the designs, everything. I always feel ""put together"" when I'm wearing Banana Republic!",5
2023,one of the best brands,5
2023,App opens fine but that is it. Once you select a category it gets stuck on the loading screen.,1
2023,App is very buggy. Slow load times and filters reset after viewing items.,2
2023,My kid loves this so I am an advoc ate,5
2023,"a few glitches here and there, but overall great experience purchasing my favorite pieces through BR app.",5
2022,"Half the app doesn't work..filters don't work, category links don't work, the whole process of trying to return or exchange an item is frustrating. Not sure what was wrong with the old version that worked just fine? This one is aggrevating to the point where I don't want to shop here until it's fixed.",1
2022,I cannot download the app.,1
2022,Poor performance and bugs summarize my experience with this app. Filtering does not work. Signing in to the app is inconsistent and load times are poor.,1
2022,Ridiculous Loading Times if it loads at all.,1
2022,I love ur style..have not change ..I was a fan.in 1990s..,5
2022,"great images, really convenient, but sometimes doesn't load.",4
2022,Such a slow app. Extremely buggy. It takes forever to load and when you go back you lose your original filtered search so you have to do the filtering all over again. Stick to desktop version,1
2022,"Banana Republic is one of my best clothing stores. They really knows how to dress a man. As a future investor, I have to make sure that I look my very best. Banana Republic makes sure of it.",5
2022,This app needs help! Takes forever to load items. Search filters need work as well.,1
2022,"Just never has or still doesn't work well, why?",1
2022,I love the quality of the clothing,5
2022,"One of the dumbest app from the retailer, the filtering never works properly, shows sizes after multiple attempts but with wrong sizes. Can't believe I am in 2022 and using an app like this. ??",1
2022,I am new to BR and I love my new style!,5
2022,Won't load any merchandise. The shopping categories lead to a blank gray dimmed page.,1
2022,great app to have although sometimes it glitches,4
2022,"No place to add redeem gift cards either on website or app, horrible design",1
2022,"Could use a better search function. Nordstrom app allows you to filter through different fabrics. Like 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, silk, etc. And has filters for blends and various other fabrics. Would be cool to see this implemented to make the user experience a lot more efficient. When looking for pants, the filter is constantly resetting every time I go back to the original page it's very annoying. Makes the app experience very unpleasant. Please just copy the Nordstrom filter.",2
2022,I love BR,5
2022,Can't live without it!,5
2022,Classic chic styles,5
2022,Easy shopping app great items I love this app .,5

2022,"i love the quality of clothing, and how it feels and the comfor.",5
2022,Quality Clothing,5
2022,"I've never seen an app try harder to prevent me from spending my money with them. Every single time I open the app it tells me I'm not signed it, so I attempt to sign in only for it to give me an error and to say ""try again later"" Even if I somehow manage to get past all the bs, the next time I go to buy something I've already been signed out due to ""inactivity"" thus forcing me to repeat the whole process again.",1
2022,Great app design. Constantly is malfunctioning and is sometimes unusable.,2
2022,party bus,5
2022,"App is slow and buggy. Trying to filter down by style and size, and it keeps hanging, then says ""something went wrong"". Way too cumbersome to shop.",1
2022,"I've been a Brand Ambassdor for nearly two decade. The quality, classic, affordable brand is my go too for the look I desire.",5
2022,I LOVE that they produce their clothes with a Tall inseam option!!,5
2022,The app looks great but rarely works.,1
2022,Love it!!,5
2022,"Well the app worked great before, why change something that worked? Now the app is trash and I can't even use it.",1
2022,Can't sign in. The text below the sign in link is blocking the link..... the website moves too slowly..... Ann Taylor it is,1
2022,"This app continues to be one of the most difficult retail apps I use. 1) takes forever to load, 2) can't read the name of the item since the character limit cuts it off. And, since BR now shows full outfits, of which the item is just one part, no idea which item is listed. 3) every time you go back to your search, all filters clear out. So, you have to search and filter over and over, 4) stop giving me the same overlay tips every time I open app. 5) checkout issues prevail. Annoying to use.",2
2022,It keeps on crashing ( android user ),3
2022,"This app was installed so I could easily pay my bill. It can't help you pay your banana card or Gap card. It has outdated information, including a phone number that's no longer in service. They switched my banana card from a visa to a master card and I didn't think it'd be a big deal but I just sunk over an hour into paying my bill. Oh, and the credit card company can't process a DEBIT card as payment in the year 2022. Not helpful to custimers. They want you to fail so they can pile on fees.",1
2022,Rarely loads properly.. No Way is this an average 4.6 rating!!!!,1
2022,App is inoperable. When I click on an item it closes out/crashes.,1
2022,Banana Republic has all I need. Perfect and classic.,5
2022,Constantly logs you out and never loads. You just get the BR logo like it's going to load something but doesn't. My big thing is how does it recognize you and say welcome back than says login?,2
2022,"When they created the new website and app to make it look ""hip"" they completely ruined the user experience for people looking to buy clothes. The actual product is being covered up by multiple layers of clothing. I used to buy clothing exclusively from banana republic but now I will never shop from them again.",1
2022,Unusable. Hangs constantly if you click on a product and then try to go back to browse. I can't even get far enough to fill up my cart. How can you build an app unable to perform its most basic function - enable shopping? Even Walmart and Target mastered this long ago. Hire better devs.,1
2022,"Great site and store for fine quality clothing. in store atmosphere is very professional and friendly. Employees very courteous, warm and friendly",5
2022,"Worst app ever, is not worth the download, is buggy, it logs you out after seconds, it doesnt responds and, as others have said, the filters suck, im deleting for now and hoping they fix it...",1
2022,Would it kill you to keep me signed in? Google password assistant doesn't work and it is a pain to copy and paste it in. Update: this app is almost unusable. It constantly logs you out and routinely fails to load pages.,1
2022,finally found a brand that stocks my styles..,5

2022,Too pricey,1
2022,Wonderful,5
2022,"Throws an error when I click on checkout, complete and utter waste of time.",1
2022,Great outlet. Horrendous app. Some of the worst sorting/filtering capabilities I've ever seen in retail (the app clears filters every item you look at an item).,1
2022,Difficult to navigate and rarely works. Embarrassingly bad.,1

2022,The best,5
2022,quality clothing.,5
2022,I love my or dinsl time,5
2022,Problem with filter. Used to be a good app.,1
2022,"Just use the mobile site. Not practical for shopping at all. Constantly logs you out, any time you look at a piece of clothing it clears your filters. Checking out was a nightmare. Got the app for the first time app user discount but it is a waste of space on your phone when the mobile site is better.",2
2022,shopping made easy,4

2022,Love these clothes and I'm 71!,5

2022,I like the clothes prices sometimes the prices are high and sometime it's affordable. I don't like the price ranges!,3

2022,"needs a ""likes"" list so that I don't have to add so much to my bag",4
2022,Need some improvements but it's ok!,4
2022,Changing password protocol is a real pain in the rear.,1
2022,"Cannot download update. Uninstalled app to install latest version but just cycles saying ""Pending"". Please fix so I can shop!",1
2022,"Does not retain login, constantly have to update and reinstall",1
2022,App functionality after update is worse than before. Not integrated with new BR Mastercard vendor Barclays. Get an error message or blank screen for almost every function you attempt to access. Desktop app works fine.,1
2022,Decoupled and annoying filtering. App does not show website purchases. Too many ways to filter shopping. Sometimes click a category expecting to see men's clothes yet women's clothes are showing. Feel like experience is not tested.,3

2022,"Any time I open the app (a few times per month), it's lost my login session, and I need to sign back in from scratch (username+password, not just fingerprint). If this is a bug, please fix it. If it's intentional... Please fix it.",1
2022,I love the quality fabrics and fashion forward designs of BR,5
2022,"The worst credit card app of any retailer I have ever tried to be a customer of. It's as though they WANT you to miss payments. I literally beg them to just take my money, but they make it so very difficult.",1
