2023,5,The app is great.
2023,1,"Not the app it used to be. It's slow, it crashes very often. The back button should be enabled."
2023,1,Sucks needs updating(app)
2023,1,"My last experience was great. App needs a health check and patches. App has no record of my last order, which made a repurchase of the same item more difficult than it needed to be. This time, I have tried to check out 4 times now. I switched payment methods to see if that helped and nothing. Since then, I have had two transaction texts come through from my CC. And my order is still sitting in my cart. Levis, please look into updating the ap. Thanks"
2023,1,"You're an abuse to be decent, but now you can't even get it to open. Please update this POS so people can shop."
2023,4,"Thank you, love levis"
2023,1,WILL NOT OPEN
2023,5,I have always loved Levi's. This app makes it so much easier to order them.
2023,1,"Cant stay logged in, doesn't have alot of certain types of levis (slim fit, dark denim, or stretch), WAY WAY WAY OVERPRICED!!! Throw the whole company away, levis has become a TERRIBLE LAZY AND GREEDY company!"
2023,5,Fantastic!!!!!!
2023,5,it's so cool
2023,5,"Relatively easy to use, prompt delivery"
2023,4,"I happen to be at a size that is not a usual combination one finds at a retailer. So happy that I do not have to sort all of the Levi's in the store that aren't arranged just to come to the realization that they have none of my size in any style. Then, thinking that I will try on something close hoping it has enough stretch, to allow it even to be buttoned. Thrilled to order the size I want and have a shot at getting through the app. Yes app could use better facets and easier payment integration"
2023,2,"OK to shop, but not buy. Higher prices than anywhere else for the same items."
2023,4,"The back button doesn't work?!?!!! This is a really sad oversight. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Now it literally won't even launch, says it gets an error. Again, this is a sad app. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"

2023,1,"Great app,especially for thin guys that is hard to find pants in my size 28.Here you can get them.in this app you tons of choices,but to bad the pants wear out in the knees in less than a year.95% of the pairs purchased had holes,they asked to send photos of the Levies lables and the holes.I took pictures and sent them in.I'm disabled and can't work so it's not from crawling around misuse.I don't know how many pics they allowed,so I sent about 6 or 8 pics they denied to replace or refund the $"
2023,1,"No response from your add on Levi's , would not show the merchandise that you have"

2023,1,The app is to hard to use and the continual popups do not make it any easier.

2023,1,Just checking it sadly no size 40's bottoms
2023,1,"App isn't working completely. I can't add items to my cart and most are almost sold out. It worked fine a few weeks ago, please help üôè"
2023,5,One of my all time favorite designer jeans wear since 1980's
2023,5,Cool üòé
2023,4,Good
2023,1,This app is painfully bad. Each time you choose a different colour you need to select your size again. It also botched processing my order multiple times. It even charged my card without processing the order. Spent some time on the phone with customer support just to get it to go through. What a disaster of an app.

2023,1,Boycott Levi's and their gender neutral clothing!

I realize I that my app needed to be updated, so I update it. I head back into the app and my cart is cleared. I try to add the product back in to the card, but now the app won't even let me add items into the cart."
2023,5,Wonderful and easy!
2023,1,"It's telling me an update is available. So I do the update, close the app and reopen the app and it's steady saying update available not allowing me to see anything. Frustrating."

App opened and asked for permission, when I clicked to grant permission it took me to another page asking for permission when I clicked that it took me back to regular page asking for same permission, asked for the same permission on 2 separate pages and kept looping back. Uninstalled waste of time"

2022,3,Levi's has always been my jeans but now they only have waist jeans nothing to prefit short people an there's nothing that makes them stand out. In crowd a woman likes jeans to fit correct an men to notice them an Levi's just doesn't do that for women
2022,5,My shopping experience was excellent!
2022,1,Used to be great but for the last three months keep getting an error. I have to uninstall and reinstall every time I want to go to the app. Very frustrating.
2022,5,Super easy to find and buy.
2022,4,Everything I am looking for is easy to find. The styles and selection makes it easy to keep my family looking good.
2022,5,very helpful to shop

2022,5,quality jeans though shipment can be better.
2022,1,The prices Levi's got in their catalogs Is way too high They don't even make the 501 button flies in the US no more and there are 60 bucks
2022,5,Love it
2022,1,Horrible interface. No purchase history. Quite an amateur effort
2022,5,Compliance with Irs **

2022,5,app works much better than the mobile website
2022,1,Not allowing me in
2022,4,Levi's pants are the best. That's for real.
2022,1,This app literally never works
2022,1,"The application does not work for more than 3 months on android. I can't buy my favorite clothes. But don't worry, I changed the brand and now there will be no spitting attitude towards me."

2022,5,easy to use app.
2022,1,"With or without Wi-Fi the app keeps buffering Or ""tailoring my experience"" and I can never get in."
2022,1,"App crapped out on me 2 days before the ""big sale"" and didn't work till the day after."
2022,5,Ordering on line is easy great discounts average pair of jeans $50.00 that best prices I've seen in a while
2022,1,Does not work on android well at all
2022,1,Just updated the app. Message Tailoring your experience and keeps circling. No app activity. Crippled. It did that before updating the app too. Have to go to the website to see anything.
2022,1,"Keeps loading and says ""tailoring your experience"""
2022,1,Literally can't even open the app
2022,4,I'm very happy with this . No one is watching me lol
2022,1,"Edit: app works TERRIBLY. I cant checkout, it doesnt allow me to select my paypal as an option. Totally unusable. can't purchase Levi's products anymore since there isn't a store anywhere close App worked perfectly. All the Levi stores around me are terrible, so I had to shop online for pants. Installed the app, created an account, searched for pants, and checked out in under 10 minutes. That's legit"
2022,5,Love the discounts. Easy to use. Great clothes.
2022,3,So annoying that this app stops whatever I'm playing when I use it. Other than that everything is great.
2022,5,Love it
2022,1,Every time I open the app it gives me a message saying an error occurred. Unexpected error. Please try again. If the problem persists please contact support. And then goes back to loading and never opens. No way for to actually contact support

2022,5,"Easy to use, simple"
2022,5,Easy to shop and place orders!
2022,1,The app is üóë
2022,1,After the last update it tells me that there's an error and I can't use the app.
2022,5,I don't know why I didn't shop the Levi app before. No more Amazon!
2022,2,slow
2022,5,Awesome and quick and most of all Quality
2022,1,Levi's as a brand is exceptional and its legacy is that of an American icon. This app is beneath you and is a pathetic attempt to dual use a subpar website. Levi's should be ashamed of themselves.
2022,1,Im remember a time when i could buy Levi's for 6 dollar's. That was in the 60s and in the 70s i didn't pay over 15 dollars for a pair. No way can i afford Levi's today for 50 or 60 dollar's. Seems like Levi's could make more money selling them cheaper like 30 dollars a pair? Millions of more men would buy them instead of cheap Walmart brands.
2022,5,"Far out, man."
2022,4,Great
2022,5,I love the savings. And the available sizes.
2022,5,So I easy to order and deep discounts
2022,5,Well designed app....super eazy 2 use
2022,1,"App not working. I log in and then a thing pops up saying error, then I hit continue and a loading screen appears with the words 'tailoring your experience' and nothing else happens. Can leave it open for hours and nothing changes. Have uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times. No use. I love the app and despise going into actual stores. Help me!"
2022,1,I've un installed and reinstalled a few times. All the notifications I receive leads to an error message. Was a decent app a few months ago! Will un install for a while! Try again next month.
2022,1,"App and website are unusably broken on mobile. Can't login, password reset email is an unformatted, distorted mess. Truly terrible."
2022,1,"When app is working it's a full 5 stars, Whenever i try to open the app i just get an error and the spinning wheel of death. I've tried troubleshooting by closing and reopening app and uninstalling reinstalling and I am still getting the same result."
2022,2,Every notification I received has ended in a error in your app. I've been holding out for the absurd amount of time for the issue to be resolved.
2022,1,I won't let me yard me password so I installed the app
2022,4,Its a product name Im somewhat familiar with sinceabout1979
2022,1,What kind of shopping app has audio that overrides my music? This one apparently. Also requires you to be logged into rewards to even browse. Simply bizarre. Who came up with this nonsense?
2022,4,Cool wish they had more size 34ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2022,5,"A bit complicated but acceptable in the end. Thank you for a great price on my favorite and ONLY blue jeans. I will continue wearing these jeans and I will be back, hopefully not too soon (your pants last a good long time!) Have a great day everyone and may your jeans ""live long and prosper!"""
2022,5,üëç
2022,5,"Haven't used yet, but I'm going to."
2022,2,Can't seem to find the right pair of jeans. Not able to speak with a customer service representative foe assistance. Not 1 store in PA sells my size or style. I've ordered online & had to return every pair ~ was really looking forward to finding the kind I used to have but NO LUCK!!!!!
2022,3,"The app crashed a few times, but the shopping experience was relatively easy and painless."

2022,3,"Ive been trying to find jeans that a re small enough. Ive got several pairs in size W23xL32. And W23xL33 witch were really big for me but ive lost weight now there way too big ,is their anyone who could take them in about 4"" in the waist and 2"" in each leg ? I need a size waist 20"" X inseam 32 ! Oh yea the app always comes up earor on me too ! And if it does load everything out of stock ,ive been waiting for months for a notification that what i want is in stock again !"
2022,3,Slow progression throughout app.
2022,4,In store purchase history crashes app. Button to close actual list in filters could move with screen when you moved too low. It's impossible to use app when you have slow wifi and phone changes to mobile.
2022,5,Helps with the buying process
2022,1,Levi's do not have prices on their merchandise they are making up their own prices and ripping people off at the end of the day at the Opry Mills location two thumbs down
2022,5,User friendly!!

2022,1,Do not order from Levi's directly unless you would like to wait at least a month to receive your order. Buyer beware. (Update) Still waiting. It is now day 33 since I placed my order. No tracking update since March 7.
2022,2,"Buggy, closes randomly, colors shuffle when you select one so you never know if you're seeing a repeat color... Pretty annoying app."

2022,1,I don't write reviews but I had to download this dumb app for an exclusive sale. Anyway this is the most garbage app out there. Freezes within seconds of booting up like it's 2006. All just to load jeans????
2022,1,I cant log in. Wont take my pass word! üò†üò° I gave up.

2022,5,"Easy to navigate. It's free to be a red tab member and you get free shipping, free returns, free hems in store and more I think. The app is really fast to load, it takes me no time at all to find the jeans I want. And they normally have excellent sales, which the app will notify you about. Love Levi's ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2022,1,"I love Levi's jeans, but recently they removed their fiber content disclosures from all of their listings. Each item used to be labeled with what it was made of (100% cotton, or 80% cotton,20% lyocell) and that information is no longer provided, which makes the app unusable for me. I will purchase Levi's elsewhere, like Nordstrom, so I can see what it is I'm actually buying."
2022,3,"3 stars for the app everything is as you want and did not give 5 star because of the service after that which is delivery. I have been waiting and it's almost a month now,ok I understand covid and winter delays 2-5 additional days but what is longer in your notice in app does it mean a year or two you should be clear about that if I knew it will take this long never would have ordered. What kind of torture is this...."
2022,1,This app doesn't function. Delete!
2022,5,"Easy transactions, excellent customer service."
2022,2,"I can't use it for whatever reason, they don't seem to know what I wanted"
2022,4,I love Levi's
2022,3,Stocked up...
2022,1,"Is it my device? Every single time I've tried to open this app, I have gotten a ""unexpected error"" message. I have downloaded it 4x and nothing. Guess I'll order using a browser."
2022,1,Can't log on
2022,5,AWESOME!
2022,5,Super cool
2022,5,I would like to buy shoes too.
2022,3,Overall the app is okay. Ran into some bugs and my return button never worked. Definitely beats using a browser to check out their listings.
2022,5,"Love levis, the only jeans I wear and the app is great for savings and whats new or on sale ."
2022,4,Pretty good for the most part. A little confusing to navigate from email sometimes.
2022,5,Fabulous üôÇüôÇüôÇ
2022,5,Love my Levi's!!!
2022,5,Great App
2022,5,Great app

2022,5,"Awesome app, very easy to order"
2022,5,Great
2021,5,Love the sales
2021,2,"Freezes, doesn't allow to back out of it, no exiting out of app.. Just needs some serious work!"
2021,4,No n Jim
2021,2,"Way too many notifications! I know I can turn off notifications, but then I'll miss the ones that I want."
2021,5,Loved it
2021,5,Great app
2021,5,I love Levi's always have.
2021,5,Such an easy way to navigate the site.
2021,1,Worst app ever . I think something is I'm stock and than it's not when I'm ready to purchase.
2021,5,Good
2021,3,"Good app. But cant change country in setting to Canada, so cant properly search nearby stores or enter my shipping location properly. So not really useful outside of US users."
2021,5,Easy to navigate
2021,3,Just had a hard time with understand everything.
2021,5,It was real nice to see some old school Levi's at the same time pictures could be a little more better
2021,5,Very Direct Poppily üòàüëøüòàüòçüòçüòçüòõüòõüòõ
2021,5,Great app
2021,5,"Very fast order placement, hope delivery is just as fast !"
2021,5,Love my Levi's!
2021,5,"Simple and to the point. I can pull it up, find what I'm looking for and order. It's got some great side benefits as well! I wish more apps were like this!"
2021,1,Doesn't let you check out in Canada
2021,5,"The app works fine for me, I can't speak on these other reviews that say it doesn't work."
2021,1,Awesome!
2021,5,Nice sales rep.
2021,5,"So far this app is fabulous. The deals will keep me coming back. I haven't tried to return anything yet but they do boast ""easy returns."""
2021,5,"Thank you for stepping up as a Corporation, to the employees who work for you all I wish them well."
2021,5,Easy to operate
2021,5,Very nice selection
2021,5,I'm a Levi's Fanatic!! Everything Levi's
2021,1,Garbage I keep enrolling under different emails and every time telling the app I'm in CANADA but then I see under my account settings that I am locked in United States and I am not allowed to use a Canadian address for shipping. Why was I linked to this app from the Canadian Levi's store and told I could get 40% off if I installed it if this garbage isn't even available to me. Get rid of this garbage the world doesn't need it or your garbage company
2021,5,Easy and fast
2021,1,Doesn't work for Canadian addresses
2021,5,"Easy navigation, with excellent graphics; product descriptions; fast and secure checkout."
2021,1,"Love Levi's in general, the app is a hot mess. I've been trying to reset my password, and cannot open the web browser page on my phone because it keeps redirecting me to the app, which does not have the capability of password retrieval. Besides this, if you aren't logged in, regular shopping features become five times harder on the app and are frustratingly difficult to navigate."
2021,3,The app consistently freezes up and crashes. New update necesssry
2021,5,Informative & good deals available. Easy to use with deals on Google Pay as well when available.
2021,5,Easy to use
2021,5,worth downloading for the in-app discounts
2021,1,Looking for pants but can't find a store for people other than black people anymore?
2021,1,"Rethink when you need choose to send a survey inside your app. Nothing worse to send out a survey when I hadn't even been in the app thirty seconds, SECONDS. Intrusive, too eager, and definitely a big way to get it uninstalled like I did. I like the product, but you couldn't pay me enough to reinstall it. Recommend, I DO NOT EVER THINK SO! üôàüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé. Did you like the review and rating to this review? Probably not, point proven. INTRUSIVE. EAGER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
2021,5,Easy to navigate.
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Love their jeans feel awesome
2021,5,App is great! Have had a lot of problems with delivery times and got purchase with security tag still on a hoodie.
2021,5,Great app with good sales! Always great prices!
2021,5,"Easy to use, aesthetician pleasing"
2021,1,Can't even create an account!!
2021,5,Awesome
2021,1,Doesn't work. Keeps me going in a circle telling me to update.
2021,4,Have not used it yet
2021,5,Easy-to-use
2021,2,"As a former Levis employee, I love Levis and I always will. But this app has been giving me nothing but issues. I've had the app since it was available for download and all of a sudden it keeps telling me there is an update available and won't let me access the app. When I go to the app store, there is no update? What gives? Looking forward to a response."
2021,5,Love to buy my pants in levi's
2021,1,I cannot change country and in shipping information I cannot enter state due to which I cannot place orders.
2021,4,Pretty decent
2021,5,I love them
2021,4,It doesn't transfer my sizes or likes along to what is being offered. So don't offer this option if I have to research sizes or preferences to see if my size is on this particular item. A waste of my time. Better going to a store to see if they may have what I want or need. Same thing. And they may be able to order what specific item I want.
2021,5,Love my 501s.
2021,5,Love them on a butt!!
2021,1,Goodbye
2021,1,Nothing special here
2021,5,Everything excellent
2021,5,Easy to use
2021,5,I love the app it's easy and accessible. I love the discounts and the free shipping. It makes it where you can afford items that you normally wouldn't be able to afford!
2021,4,"Easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for. Almost always what I need in stock, and has always been a great product."
2021,5,Easy to use app!
2021,2,App is stuck in united Kingdom and won't switch to us
2021,5,App is better and more reliable than a year ago. Good app now.
2021,5,Always Excellent!!!
2021,4,Product says I can get a specific promo if I order it from the app. Then I downloaded the app and it tells me the product isn't eligible for promo. The app works fine but I think that's obnoxious.
2021,5,"Jeans! The stores that carry jeans never seen to have jeans in stock, even before the pandemic. Glad Levi's came out with an app. Jeans come and go but at least they are always available on-line."
2021,5,A great place to purchuse your levis at almost half price when u find a sale..
2021,5,My go-to style.
2021,4,Thumbs up!
2021,5,Free shipping on first order
2021,5,I'm new! So far so good

2021,5,Great
2021,4,Would not accept my debit card but it did work with the PayPal

2021,2,I tried creating an account and it would clear my password even though it followed security rules

2021,1,"While connected to my Wi-Fi, I tried to create an account on the app only to receive an error stating I wasn't connected to the internet. Well, I am posting this 1 star review a minute later using my internet connection, no problem! So Levi's had better fix this app, since it's entirely unusable in its current state."
2021,2,Not finding anything here unfortunately ü§î

2021,5,Very good app.
2021,5,Great üëç! It has Levi's Made and crafted so that for me makes it awesome! Easy app and not buggy during browsing or checking out.
2021,5,"I got some good deals just from using the app, if you purchase Levi products allot I would recommend using this."
2021,5,This app is really great I love it

2021,5,Part of my daily routine...
2021,1,It goes to preferences and freezes.
2021,5,Always loved Levi's jeans. Amazing ppl and great jeans for anyone to wear. Love the collaborations always looking out for more :)üíóüòòüôèü•∞
2021,5,Rate your experience for how easy to use the app is. Rate this app Levi's
2021,5,Easy to use. Helps keep track of special items.
2021,1,It should let me see the deals without having to create an account im better off buying directly from the website üëéüëéüëéüëé
2021,5,Great
2021,5,NICE LEVI'S
2021,3,"It's okay. I just don't like the fact we can't use gift cards, Afterpay, or Klarna on the app. It's either PayPal or you card. I also don't like the fact that our saved for later items don't show up."
2021,5,I love using it bec it makes shopping a breeze.It is so easy to navigate.
2021,1,What do I need for a password??? I mean seriously!
2021,2,"Every single time I open the app, it takes so long to load that I have to restart it. I cannot switch between apps because every time I open another app, it closes entirely and forces me to reload it. This makes it virtually impossible to use the customer service features because it requires you to keep the app open the whole time chat is connecting you (which can take UP TO AN HOUR in my experience) and then the whole time you're chatting. Your phone becomes unavailable that whole time."
2021,5,Good
2021,5,Super easy to use
2021,5,Fast and easy
2021,4,Very good app!
2021,5,"Love it,helped me find my size ,at stores it was always out .I'm delighted"
2021,5,Seems they didn't see I was a redtag member
2021,1,Cannot reset password after many attempts over several weeks. Missed every sale over the past two months due to inability to reset password. Reset link just takes me to same login page and does not allow me to reset password. Customer service is nonexistent and does not respond to any of the 10+ emails sent. Chat is never active. I'm surprised a brand such as Levi's has such an inferior app and terrible customer service! They are obviously not concerned with the customer or making the sale!
2021,5,I just got started this app.
2021,5,Levi's app is really good to use
2021,5,Works
2021,1,"This app is garbage. I get an ""error occurred"" notification on literally everything I try to view. Useless."
2021,1,Not working on Galaxy S20 5G
2021,5,The best quality jeans.
2021,4,I have the same issue yygggggggggggggggygggygggghg
2021,5,Love it.
2021,5,Great
2021,5,None.
2021,5,Easy access along with great prices I'll definitely tell my friends about it and to continue to use when I purchase my Levi's.
2021,5,Love bought different colors of jean pants for my son when he was little boy- What A Popularly for like 300 years now.
2021,4,Great app

2021,1,Can't close the app
2021,5,Quality product for many years. They continuesly are introducing NEW fashion to accommodate all age ranges. I'm a Levi wearer to thee endüòÅüëçüíØü§ó
2021,5,IT'S ALL I WEAR AND I WEAR IT WELL!
2021,5,Love it
2021,1,Couldn't get past the welcome page.
2021,1,Worked good for my first order. Now I can't get passed the privacy policy. It freezes up and I have to shut it down. I missed the flash 40% off sale.
2021,1,It is the worst shopping app I've ever been on I never saw one Levi product I went on you five different times and still have not been able to shop you make it good woman likes to shot just crazy uninstalling this app
2021,5,I love Levi's and so far I'm really liking this app!
2021,5,Exceptional!
2021,5,Graet I fond the levis.
2021,5,Great jeans
2021,5,Wotks great hasnt crash and is easy to use.
2021,1,Never actually loads... the only screen I get is the 'tailoring your experience' page... LOVE levis jeans tho its so frustrating
2021,5,Work wonderful üëè
2021,5,I like the app. I just wish whatever size i have saved for clothes was only shown and I didn't have select it every time I purchased. I also wish Levi's would start a loyalty program and give out more discounts for those who purchase from them religiously such as myself.
2021,5,Levi's is one of my favs
2021,1,You can only use if you make an account. That's bull. Super inconvenient
2021,5,Easy to navigate and work through
2021,1,"When a company hides certain sales, promos, and even products behind an app only policy in order to attempt to force me to give up the data privacies my browser affords me so they can invade my privacy then I find a new company. Quality of your jeans has gone downhill anyway."
2021,5,Great
2021,1,It sucks
2021,1,this app doesn't work. evey time I try to log in it can't access the server.
2021,5,Great
2021,5,"Organized, quick, and easy to use"
2021,5,Just happy to finally find jeans for that special man in my life
2021,4,"Used it once, so far it's great (android). User friendly layout, pictures that you can zoom in to view, clear descriptions and available sizes. I just wish it included complete material composition (i.e: 10% spandex 90% cotton, nickel buttons/zippers, that kind of info.). Also wish it had a like/favorite option to bookmark a list of products to view later."
2021,5,"Great so far , I would like to see more options for MEN"
2021,5,Love my Levi's!
2021,1,Worst designed app I've seen. The back button an android doesn't even work you have to use the upper left hand button on app like if it was an apple app.
2021,5,Interested
2021,4,I would like to know what size I wear in Levi's Jeans if I wear a size 24 in women size.
2021,5,Fast easy to use
2021,3,Haven't tried it yet
2021,5,"Just what I wanted easy to order Levi's 501 button up fly jeans, I won't wear anything else"
2021,5,Excellent
2021,1,Would not let me out year if my birth
2021,5,love the new environmentally friendly promo
2021,5,Great clothing seriously
2021,4,"Just used it but had trouble with the promo code being used with PayPal, and PayPal might have had the problem ü§î <But overall it was applied and excited to get my items."
2021,1,It is really expensivee?!
2021,5,Amazing. üëå
2021,5,Excellent
2021,5,Great
2021,5,Good priz
2021,3,Not sure about the app. But not a dress up type person.
2021,4,Great
2021,5,"Thumbs up, Kudos, fantastic graphics, easy to use, useful and chic."
2021,1,"I redownloaded the app and tried to log in, and it was unsuccessful, keeps saying CANNOT CONNECT TO SERVER, seriously, I tried it so many times and it didn't work at all, this app is WHACK, you need to fix this and try to get the server for the LEVIS app working again, others may say it works for them but not for me. FIX THIS APP PLEASE!!!!"
2021,4,"So far the app is running smoothly (I have android if that matters), but I would like for there to be a ""like/favorite"" option so you don't have to look up an item you liked or having to pretty much ""save"" it by putting it into your bag."
2021,1,Kindly also mention the name of contry this app is for like Levi's US Levi's CA you are misguiding people
2021,5,"Love to shop here, always easy to use."
2021,5,Great place to shop
2021,1,Horrible

2021,5,So far very handy
2021,1,"Can't create an account, no matter what password I create it's not good enough. Had to delete app."
2021,4,App is decent but why can't we read the reviews?
2021,2,Just ok. The app doesn't let you create a new account. I had to enter in my info over and over and it just told me that there was an error. I got an email saying the account creation worked but it won't let you log in lol. I'd just buy off the website the app is whack.
2021,4,I can get exactly the type of jeans I have always worm.
2021,5,Levi's available at a price we can afford!
2021,5,I use the app for the codes. They are helpful when on a budget
2021,5,Hip hip hoo rayyyyy......
2021,5,Ok
2021,4,The app doesnt usually work properly. It displays items in sizes and then when you go to check out it says they are out of stock.
2021,5,Over the top
2021,5,I Love It!
2021,5,For me it's a great way to shop. Really enjoy the clothing.

2021,5,Easy-to-use
2021,2,Choppy loading and would loose from my cart while reloading
2021,5,Makes everything super fast and easy...
2021,1,Slow interface and hard to check preferences. I immediately uninstalled.
2021,5,I look forward to using this app to get some of the best deals available from Levi's store
2021,1,"I downloaded the app to easily buy clothing, not to get push notifications about Marijuana advocates."
2021,5,Love your clothing
2021,2,I haven't been able to access the app since the update. It just stays loading on the log in page.
2021,4,I'll wait to see once delivered...
2021,5,Fast so far

2021,5,Great prices and a breeze to use.
2021,5,The website is not optimized for mobile. Even on a current device and wifi I was getting incredible lag and load times that I could actually feel myself aging through. The app solves most if not all of that.
2021,5,Easiest way to get jeans that fit you perfectly.
2021,5,Easy and simple to use!
2021,1,The app in this latest update is stuck on the loading screen. Has not been fixed.

2021,5,Wonderful selections

2021,5,This app makes shopping so easy!
2021,5,Its a great app
2021,5,I love the tailored fit part.
2021,1,"The Levi's app is really glitchy, to be fair the website has almost all the same glitches and errors as the app. I've had issues with exchanges, loading product photos, and at checkout. Trying to follow links in the app like the size guide just redirect you to the homepage. Tried to place an order, the payment went through on paypal but levi's never actually sent me an order confirmation and my purchase doesn't show up in my purchase history so idk if I'll actually be getting my order or not."
2021,3,I can not comment
2021,5,Love my Levis and this app makes my shopping very quick and easy.
2021,4,I love levisüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
2021,5,Been wearing Levi's since 1978 good quality clothing Levi's is my preferred brand
2021,5,Nice app. More user-friendly than website on the phone.
2021,5,Excellent
2021,1,Until the app experiences no crashing or constant tailoring I will give it the proper rating.
2021,2,"App is essentially an in-app mobile web browser. Using the app, you'll never be able use their online size guide. It just redirects the user to their front page/international directory. I ended up with an XS shirt that fit like a Large because of it. Also, the system back-button doesn't work at all. You're better off on their desktop."
2021,5,Good. . .
2021,1,Slow
2021,3,It goes slow doesn't tell you if items are out of stock.
2021,5,Levi at ones finger tip
2021,2,"Quirky,cumbersome."
2021,5,"I order pants üëñ, I'm happy with my order"

2021,1,Mandatory Levi's account. I am not trying to sign up if I just want to browse.
2021,5,"Love the app, easy to use!"
2021,4,"Strange I have to use the app to buy, but at least they make it easy"
2021,1,"Can't use afterpay on the app, also missing customized items the site had"
2021,5,THANK YOU ALWAYS
2021,5,Great app... Hands down
2021,4,Serviceable
2021,2,So laggy . Not even wifi problem or data .you try move around it slow. I just used it for pokemon collab . Il used the website
2021,3,App is cumbersome and slow to maneuver around in.
2021,5,Levi's fits me better than some other jeans
2021,3,Items wanted two items were not in stock.
2021,1,Wack that I can't just use your website to buy stuff
2021,5,Levi 541's are the best!
2021,4,Levi's are the only jeans I buy. I love Levi's! The only reason I didn't give this app 5 stars is due to the app being slow and it won't show a size chart for USA on my app at least.
2021,5,So far so good I guess. I just installed it. So really haven't had time to utilize it.
2021,3,It takes so long to load!
2021,3,"Levi's was the only order that actually delivered on time. So thank you for that. But tired of your annoying notifications to buy something else. So Uninstalled. OLD: Why is my size crossed out (550s 36x38 in blue) other colors available, but not blue. Also hard to tell the difference in the black colors in the app."
2021,1,Can't connect to the server no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall. Also can't buy certain items unless you're on the app. Kind of a lose / lose situation.
2021,1,I would give it less than a 1 if i could
2021,5,Loved the new member discount!
2021,5,Very easy to use. I like that you can filter by style number.

2021,5,Delicious deals
2021,4,"Good app. Great product. Glitchy at times though. Overall, a positive experience."
2021,5,When you get to know that app it gets easy and fast delivery very accurate I'm very happy Price is right.
2021,5,Love the styles and the discounts
2021,5,Little slow but being a quality product center I assume it's because of having a large number of customers.

2020,5,Nice
2020,4,"I wish the App would tell me how many is left in stock intead of jumping from available to out of stock when I'm about to pay. I shop alot online and if I got an alert or some kind of notice on the availability, I would've jumped on the sale right away."

2020,2,Can't get it to down load the app
2020,3,"Levi's, what happened to Latino/Latina models in your catalog? I couldn't find any?"
2020,3,"It has every pair of Levis made but get ready to pay a premium for all of it. I never knew there were even Levis that cost $300! I've worn them my whole life and one time I paid $45 I think but im thin and 6'8"" tall and its a rarity for me to even find them in my size 34 X 38. When you go to big and tall they mean BIG & TALL. Waist sizes seem to start at 40"" and go up if they have an inseam of 36"" or 38"". IDK why this is cause now days i see a lot of very tall very thin dudes everywhere???"
2020,1,Cannot connect to the server!

2020,1,"My very first order and they cancel it after i pay. My money is now in limbo for 7-10 buisness days until refund goes through. I did nothing wrong but order from Levi's. They also used up my 20% off and free shipping on first order. Stay away, run as far as you can from this app!!!!"
2020,1,Cannot get into the app
2020,5,Love Levi's a classic my whole family wears so we order and shop in store ALL the time. I can quickly access my Levi's acct and Red Tag and easily make purchases. I receive my items faster than expected.

2020,5,Pretty good
2020,4,"Added a pair of 513s to my cart, I was very excited to buy them, and when I checked out, the app told me the denim I chose we're not available. Can you guys make it so you cannot add something, if it is not in stock. I was really bummed out I couldn't purchase the jeans!"
2020,5,Looking forward to doing business with yall
2020,5,Love levis
2020,5,Easy to use and follow.

2020,4,Pretty easy to use ngl
2020,3,Don't get to see all sizes available and really slow.
2020,4,"I Usually Order Online, But Gave The App A Try."
2020,1,Don't know how the app work. I deleted it. I shouldn't have to log in/creat account just to look at the app. I have never had a clothing app actually any app for anything make me log in just to look around. Sorry can't have all my information just to browse.

2020,5,Great app
2020,5,Great
2020,5,Prefect. Levi's are the only jeans I buy.
2020,5,üëç
2020,5,Good app
2020,5,Great
2020,5,Easy to use and great selection. Levi's are actually hard to find at stores in my area so I love the ease of shopping the app!
2020,3,"Lots of styles, but hard to find what I want. No way to compare styles, search on the number doesn't work, no links from previous order, no way to bookmark a style, very similar names makes it confusing. Different fabric contents used in different colors of the same style. Very slow to load sometimes and it isn't my phone or network."
2020,5,Great!
2020,2,Need better options for searching. Needs better online deals.
2020,5,Nice
2020,5,Cool

2020,5,Husband loves it!!
2020,5,User friendly app..
2020,5,501's baby
2020,2,Difficult to navigate through the app
2020,1,Terrible app! Lags behind like apps of 10 years ago
2020,5,Good quality.
2020,1,Terrible app. Levi's needs to update this and their website. The way they release clothes is unapologetically stupid as well.
2020,1,Can't set up account.
2020,5,Excellent
2020,3,My biggest issue is you can not track your orders through the app. It only shows you what was ordered. You have to go through the site to do that. Other than that I love the site been Levi's loyalist for 35 years. No other jeans compare. You get that tracking situation fixed and you will get 5 stars
2020,5,Great
2020,4,Husband likes 501 shrink to fit original.
2020,1,Terrible app it's like a fight to add anything to your cart or change something in your cart...terrible customer service. Paid for shipping and 13 days later no deliveries no answer from customer service üòí
2020,1,"Worst app ever for a company like Levi's to have such wasteful app, doesn't make sense. Waste of storage space"
2020,1,"Crappy app, only shows womans underwear and that's it."
2020,2,"I made a purchase for some jeans, I have a tracking number but there's no way for me to track my product. Nor do I know who it is being shipped through so I cant look it up that way. There is no customer service and it is a bad set up to navigate through the app."
2020,5,Awesome.
2020,1,Ok
2020,1,Never has my size and I'm a really hard person to fit
2020,1,Your app is buggy as hell. It takes forever for a page to load. When I add an item to the shopping bag I can't access it to checkout because the shopping bag icon disappears lol. I can't believe a company like Levi's has such a crappy app. Runs like trash on my Galaxy Note 10
2020,1,"Unable to add an item to my cart or buy anything. Tried reaching out to Levi's on Instagram, but got no response. It does say they looked at my message though, but I guess they don't think a response is important. Fix your app, Levi's and message people when they message you."
2020,5,Great Look and Feel. User Interface is friendly. Helps navigate through products very efficiently. Love it!
2020,5,Awesome App!!!
